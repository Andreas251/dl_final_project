"Finally Famous in this..\nIts crazy how they think you got it all figured out\nJust because your bank account gets all figured out\nNext time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit\nAnd they aint major shit\nDo yourself a favor: kick em out\nEat good and do that, youll live a long life\nI always say long days is better than long nights\nAt least in the day youve got shade\nIn the night its all shadows, dont get caught at wrong lights\nI wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March 9th\nI used to think theres no such things as wrong rights\nTill my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries\nExtra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe\nBut I didnt know it was off of infested streets\nNow he the reason Ive got to walk with my little niece to go eat\nI guess thats the hunger that got me out\nAt the top of hotel suites renting the lobbies out, you know?\nStuntin like a bitch, prom night me out\nAnd the girl Ive wanted since ninth grade trying to route\nThat was back\nWhen\nI was seventeen\nIts crazy though, cause even then I thought I had\nIt all figured out\nIts crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed\nSpecially if youve got a vision\nOr how you could have everything\nAnd still think about everything missing\nLike I probably remember the times that I missed out on\nMore than the ones I lived\nI probably remember the girls that I aint have\nMore than the ones I did\nBut I remain a two timing, one girl on the way\nTwo lying and one bed-never too tired\nSmoke so much I need two lighters\nShoppin overseas I do buy it, who higher?\nThey taught me that I had to dream, black history month\nI wake up and treat the day like stack history month\nIm talkin Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson\nFront of the plane: Im Rozay Parks\nSUV swervin like its O.J.s car, oh\nTo me and my dogs is all gettin out\nSomewhere in the club probably all liquored out\nFinna take extra shots for my dogs missin out\nThat keep remindin me at the same time\nThat I still aint got it all figured out\nFact, the only thing I really figured out\nIs that Ill never have it all figured out, fuck\nEven when your bank account is all figured out\nEven when your bank account gets all figured out\nEven when your best friend gets all triggered out\nEven when it.. all of it... when you still aint got....\nToday I woke up and realized every day gets shorter\nEvery minute turns to the longest second, yet never ending\nAge is nothing but a reminder and it doesnt tell you\nHow old or young minded someone is\nCause we all start at the same starting point of a womans legs\nBut each have our own finish line\nUnderstand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized\nIs to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong\nBetter to be in the hall of fame than shame\nWhether it exists for what you do or not\nWe create this world so we make what exists\nIt isnt about the award, its about the award of being immortalized\nAnd remembered for all the right reasons\nMistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps\nSo when its so late that its early\nAnd you need a drink even though the bars closed\nRemember why you do what you do\nFor the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury\nThe adrenaline rush of creating what you think about\nWith who thinks about you:\nYour family, your team\nThe joy of looking back and saying that you did it\nWinning the game: hall of fame",

"Kanye West on Why He Doesnt Care About His LegacyEvery time I crashed the internet, its like, this little drop of truth. Every time I say something that’s extremely truthful out loud, it literally breaks the internet. So what are we getting all of the rest of the time?\nI dont care about having a legacy, I dont care about being remembered. The most important thing to me is like while Im here, while were having fun, while were going to sleep, in breathing oxygen and living life and falling in love and having pain and having joy is like what can I do, what can I do with my voice, what can we do for each other to make life easier, to make life doper for our kids, you know, as they grow. You know, we were born into a broken world, were like the cleanup crew, you know\nMy mother made me believe in me. When I was growing up I wanted make video games. My mom got this Amiga computer when I was in seventh grade and it had 4,096 colors. I found myself running home to use this sound program that allowed me to place in notes, it would stay, place another note. It would stay, place another note, and its how I learned how to produce. In seventh grade I was just really making music to make video games. They just let me dream, they supported me, they pushed me, they didnt set me up to be inside of a box. Weston main thing that makes magic magic - the fact that no one believes its possible\nWhen I entered the fashion world and I encountered a lot of elitism and all that it just made me happy. It was something fun, we had the entire world against us. It was like absolutely no allies. Whatsoever, you know what I mean, it was like the world was against us, the pressure of that was like crazy, was like a Super Bowl. I remembered sitting there with my fashion publicist Debra and were supposed to do the resee, these is the thing with the editors after the show so they come back to see it and see if they like the collection, and we had like two or three people that came to see it and take picture with Kanye and bla bla etc. I say \"Do we have more editors coming\", and Debra just look and says \"No, no one else is coming\", and I looked at her and said \"This is great. Remember this moment cause it wont always be like this, embrace this moment when no one came to see the collection\". I take things that people look as a negative as an inspiration to do something better\nI think there are school teachers that are at the exact same mission as as me. I think theres police officers with the exact same mission as me. Its just help, its just do everything you got, give everything you got, and, you know, our focus needs to be less about what our legacy is gonna be or how were gonna control each other but more how can we can give to each otherKanye West on Being The Robin Hood of Fashion*Somebody please transcribe these*Kanye West on Why Hes Not in a Competition With AnyoneIm not in competition with anyone. None of us will be remembered. You know, our existence as a race, humanity in period is a blip, another second of our life in the entire scope of the universe. All these walls to keep us from loving each other as like one family, as one race, you know, racism, religion, you know, where we grew up, whatever it is, class, social network, economics, you know, all this. What makes it be so selfish, prideful, all mixes now want to help the next man, what makes us, you know, be so focus on a personal legacy as opposed to an entire legacy of a race, you know like, the dinosaurs are remembered from much more than their bones, you know. So for humanitys gone what do we give to even this little planet, you know, now wrong, and what can we do collectively, like removing the pride\n*Somebody please transcribe the rest*",
"So after walking through here I decided that I wanted to make sure for anyone that didn’t have tickets tonight that you all could have tickets to the show. So anybody who wants to come tonight, you can have tickets for the entire office!\nBut I just wanted to tell you guys: I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be “architected.” And this is the reason why even some of the first DONDA employees were architects that started designing t-shirts instead of buildings. But just to see the work actually be actualized.\nIf I sit down and talk to Oprah for 2 hours, the conversation is about realization, self realization, and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you. So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews is because I’ve tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive way.\nAnd I know that there’s more creativity to happen. And I know that there’s traditionalists that hold back the good thoughts and there’s people in offices that stop the creative people, and are intimidated by actual good ideas.\nI believe that utopia is actually possible—but we’re led by the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political. So in no way am I a politician—I’m usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct. I really appreciate you guys’ willingness to learn and hone your craft, and not be lazy about creation.\nI’m very inspired to be in this space. Tonight, this show, if you come see it—um, I’m a bit self conscious because I’m showing it to architects. So the stage does have flaws in it. It’s an expression of emotion so give me a pass on that. And that’s basically all I have to say so thank you very much.",

"I am a pop artist. So my medium is public opinion and the world is my canvas\nI’m sorry is something that you can use a lot. It gives you the opportunity to give your opinion, apologize for it, and give your opinion again. People say You shouldnt have to be sorry for your opinions ... George Bush ... has some very cool self portraits. I didnt know he was an artist!\nI felt my nerves a bit, and I don’t feel that feeling a lot. The nerves of humility and modesty when being honored, a humanization of a reality of being recognized. And all I thought as I sat there , kind of shaking a little bit, is I need to get rid of that feeling, I need to not be nervous\nThis honor is going to make your lives easier, for two reasons: You don’t have to defend me as much! And I’m going to make all of our lives easier. It is these Floyd Mayweather belts that are needed to prove what I have been saying my entire life – whether it was the sign of Paul McCartney grabbing me and saying, Its OK, he doesnt bite, or the New York Times cover, or the Time most-influential cover. And now a doctorate at the School of the Art institute of Chicago\nWhen I was giving a lecture at Oxford, I brought up this school, because when I went on a mission to create in other spaces – apparel, film, performance – it would have been easier to have just said I had a degree at the Art Institute of Chicago! Thank you\nQuestions from the crowd:\nCan I give you a hug? When are you going to open a school? What does Chicago mean to you? Can we hang out later? Do you wanna build a snowman?\nI say I wanna build a snowman because I want Bob Iger, the head of Disney, to invest in my ideas. Not one idea, not a good idea, or even a bad idea — a series of them. But just in my ideas...I feel Disney should have an art fund that completely supports all of the artists and...I feel there should be a responsibility",

"From London to Paris to Los Angeles, Hamish Bowles joins Kim Kardashian and Kanye West in their quest for world domination—and the perfect wedding dress.\nThe fast-cooling Los Angeles afternoon air is filled with the scent of eucalyptus and mimosa, the gurgle of water as it tumbles down a fountain wall into a picture-perfect azure pool, the exultant strains of Pharrell Williams’s “Happy,” and a chorus of “Old MacDonald Had a Farm,” performed in unhappy a cappella by Annie Leibovitz and Kris Jenner.\nThe frantic warblings of this unlikely duo are intended to entertain the geographically named North West, perched between her father, Kanye West, creative polyglot, and his fiancée, North’s mother, Kim Kardashian, cultural phenomenon—or Kimye, as the media has dubbed the telegenic pair while it relentlessly tracks their every move. North is poised on her mother’s knee, a knee that is currently enveloped in a fall of Lanvin satin the color and consistency of double cream, fashioned by Alber Elbaz into a wedding dress of fifties haute couture magnificence. The dress is a fitting complement to Kim’s voluptuous movie-star beauty, with her flashing Ava Gardner looks and Sophia Loren figure that have helped to establish a new contemporary body paradigm after an era of waifs.\nSmall wonder that Kim idolizes Elizabeth Taylor, whom she first became aware of as a supportive friend of Michael Jackson. Taylor once lent Kim her Cleopatra cape for a photo shoot, and Kim conducted Taylor’s last interview , about her legendary jewels. “Everything seemed so selfless for her,” Kim remembers. “We talked about the jewelry and how it ultimately didn’t belong to her; she just wanted to help people.” When Taylor’s estate was sold to benefit the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, Kim even acquired some of those jewels herself. She also went to look at Taylor’s house. “It was just so enchanting,” she remembers, “with a garden with really pretty trellises and beautiful roses, but it wasn’t realistic for me to purchase. It only had a one-car garage.”\nAlthough North has inherited her father’s furrowed, quizzical brow, the pretty ten-month-old who is the focus of all this attention seems an island of preternatural serenity in the roiling sea of frenetic activity that is la vie Kimye.\nNorth’s parents have already involved her in their creative lives. “I take pictures of her all the time and dress her up,” says Kim. “I put Kanye’s big chains around her, and I put a little Louis bag and some Jordans, and I was like, ‘What up, Daddy?’ ” Kanye, meanwhile, has made an adorable little stop-frame video of North caught in her natural movements that he’s edited to make it appear as if she’s break-dancing.\n“Anybody need anything?” asks the agelessly glamorous, apricot-skinned Kris, fluttering eyelashes as thick, long, and lustrous as a hummingbird’s wings. “Water? Vodka? Get on my train!” she laughs. “Just kidding!” Kris is an astute businesswoman and an executive producer of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, now in its eighth season. Her home office is stacked with Kardashian product and magazine spreads—there is even a framed copy of her estranged husband Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner’s 1979 GQ cover.\nWhen Kim was an impressionable little girl, she remembers, her fashion-mad mom “would always wear really tight—she was into Vicky Tiel, Moschino, or Chanel—with huge Moschino heart earrings. She had an amazing body and was always so in shape. One time Kourtney and I sat in my mom’s closet—we must’ve been eight or nine—and we were like, ‘If Mom dies, we’re going to write down who gets what.’ We went through every last piece of her wardrobe. We were so mean then!”",

"Ellen: How do you think marriage has changed you, if it has?\nKanye: Ive definitely learned how to compromise more. Which is something you have to understand when you partner with people in business. You know, you cant--\nEllen: Beautiful\nKanye: And Ive learned how to shut up more and, um, Ive--yeah. I think--I think Im a better human being, you know, because of her\nAnd because of my daughter. And I have, you know, always someone to think about going home to and, you know, something for me to, you know, not only be brave for what I wanna do for humanity but also to be more protective of myself for my family too. Cause theres things Ive done in the past that were considered negative, but I was really, you know, jumping in front of the tank for other people or for culture in a way. So now I always have to have that in my mind, that I have, like, a family that I have to protect too\nEllen: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I do see that change in you. I see you-- And you are calmer, I think. You know, you dont seem, like, uh... like, uh...angry or--you know? You know what I mean? And I dont know if it was even anger, but it was just the way that you were getting all of your emotions out. And now I think your emotions\nAre grounded in a way that they come out in what you said and protection and love, and--and--theyre going-- theyre channeled\nIn a different way\nKanye: I think I was, like, going through now, like, my version of my terrible twos. My--my daughter, she wants to express herself, but she just doesnt have the words for it. And for me, theres so many things I wanna do with film, with clothing, and I just didnt have the words or the resources or the backing or the perception that I could do it, being that I was a rapper or, you know, all these things. And now, because of this Adidas deal, they allowed me a little bit of oxygen. Because what you have to understand-- The difference between, you know, what people give you about celebrity, the idea of money versus creativity. Theres no amount of money that someone can give you to make you not be creative, if you were born to create. So a lot of times people try to block you, block your creativity, control you with money. And Adidas allowed me to make my whole clothing line, which I wanted to do, and it was just like a little bit of oxygen. You guys last year, two years ago, three--whatever. You guys were seeing someone being suffocated by a perception. Being suffocated by people in a position that could\nBlatantly see like, \"Wow, the \"Yeezys\" did really good. He was this influential. All those albums did this. But were not gonna give him\nA shot in something else.\" And theres a lot of people who, like, were really calm about that. But the definition of crazy is trying to do the same thing and expecting a different result. So I tried something different over the past couple years. And I actually got some really good results from it too, so...\nEllen: Well put. Well put. And that is true. I mean, I think we all try to express ourselves. And you do, you keep doing the same thing and saying the same thing and saying the same thing. It doesnt get\nThe result you want until you try a different way of expressing yourself or whatever it is, and then you get the result because youve shifted. We have to take a break. And then were gonna show the world premiere of your new video, which I absolutely love. I love this song so much. You actually played it for me in our living room, and I just was blown away how beautiful the song is\nCut\nEllen: So, uh, more kids?\nKanye: Yeah, were trying\nEllen: Really?\nKanye: Yeah, yeah\nEllen: I thought Id slip that in there. I mean, that baby is so adorable, and, I mean, she is precious. Shes so-- And smart as can be, right?\nKanye: Mm-hmm\nEllen: Yeah, shes-- Oh, look at that. So youre gonna have more? How many do you want, like a bunch? Like a Brad and Angie bunch? Or, uh--\nKanye: I just want whatever Kim wants\nEllen: Wow. Um... Thats--thats a good answer, whether its true or not. And what is the name of the CD?\nKanye: I dont know yet. Were still trying to find it. Trying to find the vibe. You know, this transition from what I felt when I did \"Yeezus\" to what I feel now, and, you know, were just creating. So we havent found it yet\nEllen: Okay. What about \"Ellens My Friend\"?\nKanye: Yeah. I think thats pretty good\nEllen: Okay, think about that",

"React how you want. Any energy you got is good energy. You know, the Confederate flag represented slavery. That’s my abstract take on what I know about it.\nSo I made the song “New Slaves.” So I took the Confederate flag and made it my flag. It’s my flag now, now whatchu gonna do?\nIt looks cool. I like at maybe 800 images a day. You know, I’ve been working on clothing seriously for the past 11 years.\nIt’s colorless also. It’s super, like, hood and super white-boy-approved at the same time. And that’s really what my style’s always been, because I lived in the suburbs, where, you know, I was known as the Black kid, and I lived in the hood where I was known as the kid who spent his summers in the suburbs.\nMy dad was a military brat, and he would be around white people back then when it was like, racism was really popular and people would be racist against him, and he’d get around Black people and they’d kinda discriminate against him because they’d say he acted ‘white’ or talked ‘white.’ So there are times when I’ll talk and you’ll hear some of that white--or what people call ‘white’--the suburb voice come through and it’s times you’ll hear some of that Chicago come through. I’m influenced by all those things.\nI lived in China when I was in fifth grade with my mother, she’s an English professor, and she taught high-level English. And it was my hint at being a celebrity because they hadn’t seen Black people on TV, so people would stare at me all the time.\nThere will never be another Backstreet Boys, Not in this day and age. It’s gonna be artists like Lorde, singer songwriters, that are gonna come up. This is Instagram, this is the information highway. And I talk to these heads, you know, these older dudes that run companies, and it’s hilarious to me! I only listen to people who are younger than me! These are the only people with ideas. You cannot give me any advice! You can help me. You can support Donda. You can cut a check. But I have the ideas! No one older than me has a better idea than me because I’m the only 36 year old me! I’m the most relevant voice on the planet Earth, at age 36, post being the most hated. So don’t try to tell me anything! Help me! Help me, help other people.\nWe are uncomfortable. 500 kids are dying in Chicago a year. We are uncomfortable. Just because we’re being a gated community doesn’t mean that things are comfortable.\nThe thing is, we have the resources on this planet to have a human utopia, to have respect for each other, mankind. We have that. But we’re too concerned about getting the next Hollywood film on Netflix. We have the resources. There’s new billionaires everyday. You apply the right type of thinkers, like the Elon Musks, the people with the real ideas.\nLike, politics is dead. It’s over with. These kids need some type of real truth.",

"Since Fern Mallis, I just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult and I have encountered countless amounts of bigotry along the way. I have millions of ideas and I represent a new generation just trying to express themselves in a broken world. I dont call myself a designer as I was not allowed to go to Saint Martins because I was too famous by the time I realized I wanted to design. Fame is often looked down upon in the design world so its actually been something I had to overcome. All we have are our dreams and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want but we wont stop fighting. We want to innovate and we will win someday.

"How many of you people came here with someone you love tonight. If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. Hold on, hold on. If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. If you love somebody tonight, hold on, hold on. Hold on tonight\nTonight I was thinking about being as safe as possible, I dont want to say nothing politically incorrect. A very safe musician. Ive been thinking about it. Ive been thinking about going backstage and not saying nothing at all, is that cool? Uhh, before I go back there I got to ask you one question. Just one real quick. Just one. CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? Can I talk my shit? Can I talk my shit? Its like I always find, I always find, I always find something wrong. Cause Ive been putting up with they shit just way too long. Im so gifted at finding what they dont like the most. So if they find that they dont like the most\nYou know, its so interesting cause theyre trying to make me, like you just read the, Dont me ask about the motherfucking mask, you know what it comes off of. . Its the Yeezus shit. You know when you, if you read the headlines and read like, random blogs or whatever the fuck they might put up, you know, its funny how they, they always try to bring up the negative or, bring up the things that sound the most out of context. You know its like, have you ever felt out of place ever, like, out of context like someone just didnt understand, like they just didnt understand what you wanted to do, what you was trying to do, or what, or what you was dreaming of. Have you ever, have you ever been scared to say, to say your dreams out loud? Have you ever been just a little bit afraid to say your dreams out loud? Have you been afraid to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream out loud?\nI had a dream. I had a dream that I was Steve Jobs. I had a dream that I was Walt Disney. I had a dream that I was The Wright Brothers. I had a dream that I was Thomas Edison. I had a dream that I was Mandela. I had a dream that I was Martin Luther King. I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream. I had a dream, I had a dream. And Im not afraid to dream out loud. You know you just get so scared that people are gonna think youre crazy, or that youre stupid, or that youre foolish, or this is the time that everybody thinks youre losing your mind, but Im not losing my mind, Im using my mind! Im not losing my mind, Im using my mind. So dont mind me, dont mind me, dont mind me. Im not losing, Im not losing my mind, Im using my mind. So dont mind me, nevermind me, never, never, nevermind me. If what Im saying, appeals to you, and makes you feel like you can be a better you, than thats good for me. And if what Im saying offends you, and makes you feel like the worst you, than thats good for me too, true. Thats good for me too, true. Thats good for me too, true\nCause theres only two types of people, theres dreamers and theres haters. Theres dreamers and theres haters. And all Ive been doing recently is cutting the grass real low. So if you a dreamer, everybody will know. And if you a hater, make yourself be seen, CAUSE I DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU, THATS WHAT I MEAN! Cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low. I find , cause I feel like I just try sometimes. And Im not afraid at all. Im not afraid to fall. Im not afraid to fall. Im not afraid to fall. Im not afraid at all. Im not afraid at all. THEY CANT STAND ME! THEY CANT CONTROL ME! THEY CANT HOLD ME! THEY CANT HOLD ME! THEY CANT HOLD ME! THEY CANT HOLD ME!!! THEY CANT HOLD ME!\nI aint saying, when I say you Im talking about public perception, Im talking about backlash, Im talking about all the tools they use to hold dreamers back, to make them look like motherfucking lunatics. How many people you know, that you talk to on a day to day basis, that made a motherfucking mountain open up in Tampa tonight? So all the other shit Im talking about, is it crazy or is it possible? Put your hands up if you think anything is possible. Put your hands up if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible. Cause God made us in his image. And God made us all artists as children, God made us all artists as children. And somehow that peer pressure takes the artist out of you. Somehow the world can leave you so confused, and you forget who you are. But Im remembering, Im remembering, Im remembering\nCause most people, you know they say, they say people in my position, what ever that position is, like a celebrity or you make money, you have some type of status or some shit, you dont wanna fuck it up right? You dont wanna ruin your name, you dont wanna say anything wrong. So what you do is you get on TV you just smile, you just wave, and you try to be as safe as possible, cause you dont wanna fuck up enough, BUT I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP!!! I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP! I WANNA FUCK UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE CAUSE Im STILL BEATING! As long as my heart is beating, as long as Im dreaming. And Imma stay kicking and dreaming, kicking and screaming, kicking and dreaming\nI feel like its my responsibility to turn up. I feel like its my responsibility to turn up. And I stand here, the Gemini that I am, and there are so many examples throughout our history: Miles Davis, Biggie Smalls, Lauryn Hill, Prince, 2Pac. The Gemini that I am, it is my responsibility to turn up and tell you the truth. And if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, and if I, if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, the rest of the time, what the fuck were they telling you? If I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, what the FUCK were they telling you?!? What the fuck are they telling you? So dont let nobody kill your dreams, dont let nobody tell you what you can do. Cause the more you accomplish, the more they wanna say you look like a fool. Following what you want to tonight, and you gotta an opportunity in the world\nHow many people are under 20 tonight? How many people are under 30 tonight? Under 40, under 50, under 60, GOD DAMMIT YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ARE LIVING, YOU ARE BREATHING, SO YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THIS WORLD!!!",

"Wait a second, would you rather me not talk at all? ’Cause I don’t want to like, I don’t want to rattle no cages or nothing, I don’t want to like, I don’t want to get in trouble. I want to be scared. I’m trying my best to be scared. I’m trying my hardest to be scared. No, no, no, I don’t want to talk. I don’t want to talk at all. As a matter of fact I’m just going to tip-toe on this\nI’m scared of anonymous comments online. I’m scared of them. These words affect me so much. They affect me so much. No, I’m sorry. I’m scared, I’m scared. I’m scared of these corporations, like, not giving me another deal that they didn’t give me already. I’m scared. I’m scared. I’m so shook. I’m so, so scared. So scared. Soooo\nYou ain’t never seen, you ain’t ever seen, that my great, great, great, granddaddy somehow ended up on that boat. Somehow he ended up on that boat. But I know that we were royalty. I know we built the pyramids. I know anything is possible. I know anything is possible. And everybody has a moment in time and I picked y’all when I was walking in Madison Square Garden, I just wanted to make sure, thank y’all for giving me this moment in time. ’Cause everybody has a moment. And in your moment you gotta own it. There’s so many people have a moment and they don’t own it\nYou know, it’s so funny when people compliment me and they say the word genius, and somehow that like, separates me from rappers in some way, there’s the connotation of that. But what I need y’all to realize is Jay Z is a genius. And I need y’all to understand that Drake is a genius. I need y’all to understand that rap is an amazing way to express genius\n’Cause just as an architect would build buildings, we put our words together to express the shit that we going through. We are the modern day poets, obviously. But why are so many writers so condescending to the rappers? Why do they try to classify us as musicians as being ignorant in some way? Why do they try to classify us, as far as the classes go? You know how it goes, right? I think it’s like a battle between art and architecture as the top. And if you’re an artist or an architect, you look down upon a fashion designer. And if you’re a fashion designer, you look down upon a musician. And if you a musician, you sign a deal with a corporation so you can buy a bigger house. And every time you go in the studio you watch your fucking mouth\nYou watch, you watch your fucking mouth. You don’t, you don’t want to lose this house. But when they write these history books, they’re not going to talk about what house we had. When they write the history books they aren’t going to talk about the money we made. They’re going to talk about the impact we had. They’re going to talk about the impact we had\nAnd being that I saw The Hunger Games today, I wanted to bring up something, because it was very inspiring. It felt like almost a mimic of my exact life and shit. I know it. I was like, “Baby we gotta be on that movie board when they writing this shit.” And I saw Lenny Kravitz. There wouldn’t be no song called “Niggas in Paris” if it wasn’t for Lenny Kravitz. ’Cause that was the first nigga in Paris. Fucking with the models and shit, rocking Rick Owens head-to-toe and shit. Black. Rock. Star\nBut what’s interesting to me is like I was fond of hanging out with different people, in Paris, right. ’Cause Lenny Kravitz has like, the best taste. And he has like the dopest crib in Paris, everybody knows about it. And I don’t know if you know this, but he designs furniture, he designs lighting fixtures, and he had been working on a clothing line for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time. Long time. Long, long, long, long time\nAnd the designers would love it when Lenny Kravitz would show up at their fashion show. Yeah we gonna take some pictures of Lenny Kravitz and we gonna say he’s at the such and such show, and that’s gonna promote our brand. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Best you can. Hey Kanye, promote it the best you can. Hey Kanye, promote us the best you can. From Paris to New York all the way to Japan. Hey Kanye, I mean Lenny, I mean any of you niggas, promote it the best you can. Any of you niggas promote if the best you can\nSo I said, “Wait a second, though.” I said, “I’ve got a dream of doing my clothing and I, I want to learn about furniture,” and you know what they told me when I was in Paris? You know when the W Magazine writer came out and wrote that classist-ass interview about me? You know what they said? You know what the billionaires told me? I went to about three or four different people and you know what they told me when I told them about my dreams? They said, “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” They said, “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” Don’t let me sing because I want y’all to understand that I need to talk to you. They told me, “Hey that’s cute, that’s the same thing Lenny wanted to do.” Like it’s a motherfucking joke. It wouldn’t be no Kanye west if it wasn’t for Lenny Kravitz. You know what I’m saying?\nBut the only difference between me and Lenny Kravitz is I turned up on these niggas. I don’t give a fuck about looking cool or being cool. And this is no disrespect to Lenny. But they got this shit called cool, everybody want to look cool, everybody want to be cool, everybody don’t want to break their motherfucking cool, don’t nobody want to look like a fool\nMy boy , who used to work for Donda and now designs stages for Jay Z and Justin. The other day he said a word that I hadn’t heard people say before. And he said he was working at some corporation, and the head of the corporation is always like, kind of down on him and shit, and the word was to marginalize. To marginalize. And then he also said he tried to make him look like an idiot in front of people, right? So has anyone here tonight ever read a piece of press or saw something or heard something on the radio where they tried to make me look like an idiot? Wait a second, I don’t know, have you ever heard anything in the press where they’re trying to make me look stupid? You know what I’m saying, like I’m actually stupid. You know what I’m saying, like I’m not smart, like stupid. Like, like what the fuck is wrong with him? You know what I’m saying? Have y’all ever read or heard someone say, “I don’t like Kanye West”?\nI’ll tell you something. Have you ever heard anyone talk shit about Lenny Kravitz though? He’s a nice guy. He’s a nice guy. He’s so well-mannered. I envy manners. I envy it. I envy people who are extremely likeable. I’m like, “Damn, I wish I could be likeable like them.” I wish people would like me like that\nSo what they basically did was, at Fashion Week… Let me explain something to you… I don’t give a fuck about fashion. I care about talent. I care about creativity. And it just so happens that with the advent of the Louis Vuitton bag, fashion rise to the top, and stole all of the creativity to only work for its small box, and sell it back to you at a higher price. That’s what the fuck fashion is to me. I care about dreamers. I care about heart. I care about soul. Not those who are marginalized\nSo if you think about someone like McQueen. Instead of being forced to make some fucking T-shirts with a skull on it, why wasn’t he allowed to make movies? He was just as good as Tarsem, he’s just a good a visualist as anyone else. But they would marginalize him as only a fashion designer. Which, let’s rewind, is above a music producer, and it’s above a rapper\n’Cause you gotta stay in your tier, in your section. You gotta stay right there, you can’t move. But if you pay for a ticket, you wanted to come to see this show, and you standing right there, right? And when you’re trying to go you say I want to go up there, a security guard stops you, and then holds you, and if you start screaming the paparazzi catch you, catch you with your face looking all crazy, and then you scream out loud, and you got to really scream, you gotta say, “I am a god!” Just for them to let you a little bit up\nBut you know who fucked it up for everyone? Marc Jacobs. Because he gave two niggas a shot, me and Pharrell. He fucked the whole game up, and Pharell’s such a nice guy. ’Cause soon as I was able to make that Louis Vuitton sneaker, and the world reacted—I didn’t price it, but the world reacted to it—I got to see what it meant to create inside of that type of production facility. And wait a second, the same guy that was creative enough to make all of this , that’s worn Jordans his whole life, could create a sneaker with Louis Vuitton and people reacted to that. And I said, I made another color. I did a pink model, and I did a red model, and I named them after my friends. I made one in Jasper after Ivan Jasper and one Mr. Hudson after Mr. Hudson, and one, the Louis Vuitton Don, for my nigga Don C. And that last day in the factory, I was going through the colors and it came to me, when they made me do a couple pictures and shit, and I called back after they sold out. And they said, “I’m sorry, Mr. West, but you’re not going to be able to create anything else in here. You’re not going to be able to create anything else again.” They said, “I’m sorry,” and I said, “But wait a second. I sold out.” They said, “I’m sorry Mr. West, you can never create anything else again.”\nAnd right there, I was scared. Right there I was scared. ’Cause I thought that if I just went to their fashion show again and I just sat down like a good nigga they would let Lenny Kravitz get his shot! I thought maybe, maybe they would let Pharell get his shot. But no, no, no. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you? ’Cause that’s what it is. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you?\nAnd what about Mark Parker, and what about Hedi Slimane? I thought Hedi Slimane was my friend, and that’s why I’m so hurt. How many names did people call me for wearing tight jeans when I’m the rapper that wore tight jeans and shit, that brought tight jeans to the ghetto and shit? I thought I was Hedi Slimane designing motherfuckin’ tight jeans that you want. I’m the nigga that, you know I’m rocking that shit. Then he had his first fashion show, and I was so happy for him. I was so, so, so happy for him. And he told me, you can come to my show, but you just can’t go to Riccardo’s show and you can’t go to Phoebe’s show\nBut he wouldn’t say that to Anna Wintour. He wouldn’t say that to . And now his whole shit based off of rock and roll, and you trying to tell the number one rock star on the planet where the fuck he can go? So he can sell y’all, some motherfucking $10,000 pair of jeans? Fuck fashion. Fuck fashion. I mean, what’s the worst thing they gonna do, not help me again? What’s the worst they gonna do tell me I can’t go to these shows again? What’s the worst they gonna do, tell me that because I’m a musician, I don’t have any ideas for clothing again? What’s the worst they gonna do, marginalize me again? And never let Pharrell get his shot, and never let Lenny get his shot?\nBut I’mma tell y’all right now, I will take that spot. I am 2Pac of this clothing shit. And I’mma take that spot, and we gonna combine all the creators, the best creators on the planet, and we gonna lower the motherfucking prices, so everybody can get it. And we ain’t gonna steal from people’s ideas like H&M. And we ain’t gonna steal people’s ideas like Zara. We gon’ make our own shit. We gon’ combine the best creators on the planet, and we gon’ take them from Harvard, and we gon’ take them from St. Marks, and we gon’ take ’em from the street\nAnd I’m sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin’ hit song tonight. I’m so sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin’ hit song tonight. Hit song tonight, hit song tonight. Another hit song, another hit song. Yes they do. I ask people about it, I tell them that I’m this creator, and they say I need another hit song. They say I need another hit song, hit song tonight, hit song…\nHold up, hold up. I’m sorry, if anyone out there thinks they can do anything, put your hands up right motherfuckin’ now! Almost forgot that part",

"Preface\nIn this conversation, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams candidly explore the rewards and perils of a lifelong, perfectionist ethic. Best likened to a childs insatiable curiosity, they impute their compulsive, insistent tinkering to much lived experience, and even to obscure neurological phenomena. Their exchange lends precious – and comic – insight into a frightening capacity for invention, and a knowing approach to craft that is at once sure and relentlessly self-critical. They spoke in the wake of a minor controversy that followed the online launch of the single “Theraflu”, which Kanye released through his G.O.O.D Music label . Predictably, the pharmaceutical combine Novartis objected to the title. The track also featured the lyric “someone tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor,” which drew immediate fire from the animal-rights group\nKanye West: Yo yo, what’s good?!\nPharrell Williams: What up, killer?!\nKW: Shit, chillin’, vibin’ about changing the name of that song and trying to figure out what the name of the song should be. You know, the “Theraflu” song?\nPW: Yeah\nKW: Yeah, we’re about to give it a new name\nPW: It’s getting that big – they’re going that crazy about it?\nKW: Oh, yeah they have an issue. Just the title and here’s still a window of opportunity for us to change it. “Oh, well, I don’t want to call it ‘Theraflu’. I’m calling the song this…” And then people are like, “oh, he changed the song to this”, and then that’s what it is, because when I did the song, I actually did not know that it would get to the point that grandmothers are talking about it, you know? Like why did I give them that level of promotion?\nPW: Yeah, trust me, they’re thankful. No matter what, they’re thankful. This segues perfectly into what I wanted to talk to you about. Which is what is it like to be – and I know how I feel about it – but you’re definitely one of my peers, and one that I look at and say “He gets it, but I’d love to hear his take on why we aspire to be.” It’s almost a disease to be a perfectionist. Nothing is ever quite good enough. What is it like to look at things and say to yourself, “I know that they don’t get it but maybe one day they will.”\nKW: It is so funny this is such an example of being a perfectionist, right? This song is out and I’m going to change the name, like I want to perfect this moment some more. Well, I think it’s just if you’re a perfectionist, that’s just what you do. You know, there are slackers there are people who are satisfied by delivering everything they have – with their knowledge, their financial situation, their level of exposure – to deliver the best product possible. I respect, look up to, and look to Walt Disney and Steve Jobs who dedicated their time, soul and energy to delivering the best product that they knew they could. There’s a lot of psychology that goes into it. What can you give to human existence? How can you push the culture forward? And when you’re a perfectionist, at a certain point you feel a responsibility in what you put out, and what could trickle down from it. If you put out things that are so over-the-top and magnificent, what trickles down from it could at least be good because there are more followers than there are leaders\nPW: Yeah I agree…You know what the funny thing is that we’ve never done it on a Kanye West album, it might be time for that\nKW: Yeah!\nPW: It might be time for that\nKW: Yeah, we started on that shit for The Throne\nPW: Oh yeah! That was a very serious moment…\nKW: Yes!\nPW: I’ll never forget going to you and Jay’s show, and just seeing those laser lights. You addressed all the sensations, with the exception of smell and taste, I guess. Anything that you could control, the auditory and the visual, you curated – you made sure that it was a curated moment. And I’ll never forget when the first bars of “Gotta Have It” started playing, that minor chord. It just hits you anyway but it was just y’all talking on top of the track as it starts to come on, and the crowd start going nuts! And it’s really because at the end of the day, as great as the track is as it is and as great as all of the stuff you guys did on top of it, it was how the moment was so set up. It was like an incredible layup, an alley-oop. Do people even say that word anymore, alley-oop?\nKW: Yeah, it’s only ‘cause it happens\nPW: yeah, you know I don’t know anything about basketball, but it was an amazing set-up. That was crazy, just to see the reaction to what a visual and music could do together, and those people going absolutely crazy I was like “oh, ok, well done man, well done.”\nKW: Yeah I definitely wanted to dial into that sound and mixing those textures together. I just want to dial into that more, I just want to set the note, like playing a few textures that I got for this new shit for the G.O.O.D. Music joint we opened up the album with this joint that me and Skrillex did together\nPW: Mmmmm. I like that!\nKW: Just like that!\nPW: Wow, I can’t wait to hear what that sounds like. I know we are all shaped and moulded by all that we’ve gone through, and by having spirituality – in whatever way you define it – it allows us to be bigger than our bodies, to be bigger than our essence. there is something to be said for experience, being told “no” the entire time, when you wanted to get into an industry that you love. So let me ask you, how much has this experience contributed to who you became as a person?\nKW: Yeah, you know, I had to realize at what point to put off the real South Side Chicago mentality, that is what built me to deal with the amount of “no’s” and deal with the amount of pressure and aggression, like I talked about on this Chicago song, “mink is draggin’ on the floor.” That’s one of my ideas for it . “Swag King Cole, mink is dragin’ on the floor, fo’ I embarrass you, but I don’t like to embarrass you…’I Don’t Like To Embarrass You” as the title\nPW: Anticipating PETA\nKW: Yeah, so…when I say “I’m from where shorty’s fucked up, double-cupped up. Might even kill some-body and YouTube it, so whoever thinks their words affect me is too stupid, and if you think you can do it better than me, then you do it.”\nPW: Yeah, “you do it!”\nPW: \nKW: “I’m from Chicago.” And that was just one of the best things to prepare me for anything. If you can make it out of Chicago, you can make it anywhere. That’s what I’m talking about on this new song, that’s what I’m talking about when I’m dealing with any business or creative processes. That’s the stuff I’m talking about when I was dealing with people, from not wanting me to rap, to doing the tour with Jay, and being able to do the light show for it It was like sit-ins, when we were going out to Paris. You know when we were wearing the outfits and people on the blogs were calling us names and all that, right? But then, once they got that Givenchy cover, and everybody’s wearing Givenchy they’re all like “oh this is cool.”\nPW: Right\nKW: But it wasn’t cool with South Park was using the photo and dissing us and everything. And so many people dress like that now\nPW: Yeah, that’s what we do\nKW: That was before everybody said swag, or when we were out in Japan. How could you communicate through people? We’re not even understanding the language but we knew the visual language, we knew the spirit, we knew the ideas, we knew the reference points\nPW: Yeah, that’s the thing, man. That’s what separates us from a lot of folk, and not because we’re better but because we’ve dedicated to listen to that inner voice, and a lot of people don’t. A lot of people go “man!” they do something and they go “shit you know what, and I’m totally not da-da-da-da .” People fail a lot of times doing that. Whereas we just trained ourselves to say “you know what, let me entertain this idea” and exhaust all the possibilities to make sure that it doesn’t make sense because something good may come out of that and for every time that someone has ever told you no, you’ve always had that willingness to explore it. Um, and I’ve watched that by the way, it’s been cool to see. How are you enjoying that…\nKW: - Enjoying what?\nPW: I’m thinking of a way to put it…How are you enjoying this whole fame thing?\nKW: You know its just a process of separating things, it’s understanding how to exploit it to display things, it’s understanding how to exploit it to display amazing art. You know the whole trick is that I am a visual artist. To this day I can’t play piano. I’ve taken it up a couple of times and I forget how to play the piano. And when I first wanted to rap, before I rapped, the first thing I did was actually draw my tape covers because that’s back when people had tapes. I drew the cover before I even thought about doing music. Let’s put this information in Vegas to music. So ina way I’ll get the music but it was always about the fountain. It was always about the light show. It was always about the fashion show, it was always about that. Whether it is the font that we pick for a single cover, or a video – I’m going to Qatar later tonight to shoot the film for “Cruel Summer,” which is basically my second pop fairytale, like how “Runaway” was – it creates that kind of opportunity. When you see me design, and I’m not saying it’s the best design or whatever, but you know, I had my idea of how I wanted Selita to look, and I wanted it to be Selita. I wanted to juxtapose minimalist, Vanessa Beecroft like high art against unrealistic Victoria Secret-level beauty. They don’t crash, those words are not in the same place. You’ve been to art parties before? It’s different from a Victoria Secret’s party. You know what I’m talking about!\nPW: Right!\nKW: That’s right. Due to exposure, I’m able to have these things be seen by so many people. If Matthew Barney were more famous, then more people would see what Matthew Barney did. So it’s that. When it comes down to it, what I enjoy about it is the opportunity to express art in high volume, literally\nPW: Did you know that you’re a synesthete? That you have synesthesia?\nKW: That’s what it’s called, that’s what the film is about! You’re talking about seeing sounds right?\nPW: There are many different forms of synesthesia. There are grapheme synethetes, people who see colors in numbers, letters in colours. But I believe most musicians and most artists are synesthetes\nKW: You know that’s what this film in Qatar is about!\nPW: Oh wow!\nKW: It’s called Cruel Summer: The Legend of the Lamborghini Dons and it’s basically the G.O.O.D Music Lamborghini Dons. Cudi, he’s the main character and I’m just this boy, and in the beginning we’re car thieves. There’s this part where one character teaches another to see colours through sound\nPW: Oh wow!\nKW: Yeah, the shit is dope. Matter of fact, if we could do work with you on the soundtrack. I mean I’ve got eight tracks for it, I just want to give it twelve. Basically it’s the G.O.O.D Music soundtrack that “Mercy” is the first single for. You’re like next level with this type of shit like “Take me far away, as long as it’s fun, fun, fun, I wanna go.” I’m talking to actually a film scorer at this point so –\nPW: No! But dude….Nah man! It’s funny that you picked that out . That’s funny, wow!\nKW: I play that song real normal in the car\nPW: No way?!\nKW: Yeah!\nPW: That’s crazy, that’s crazy. ‘Aight well say no more. I’mma holla at you soon. And you have a good time out there in Qatar. My man!\nKW: Alright, thanks! Love",

"So now, that was funny, right?\nI imagine the skit was probably funny too.\nIt wasn’t that funny, to be honest with you. It was a five, I’d give it. So I do want to ask you one more thing about the tweets because I just want to be clear--bring up that...yeah, that--do you really think I look like SpongeBob?\nIt’s the first thing that came to my mind.\nWhere were you when you were writing those tweets. I like to imagine, on the toilet.\nYeah, that’s when I think of the best shit.\nI was just at my place here, my old home here in LA. As we were writing it, there was a frustration I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me as I was writing it, and I just thought it was so amazing that I was saying this in real time, in real life. You know, with my position, people are so scared to say anything, you know, as soon as you’re a celebrity, you’re not to say anything anymore. But just to completely wild out…\nThe only reason I could do that is because we could speak on a similar level, and we can go back and forth.\nIt was a crazy thing, to see that happen, as far as just the technology, and all of a sudden, everyone in the country knew you and I were having a really dumb fight.\nI just thought that that was amazing, to crack media, in a way. You know, I feel that media does everything they can to break creatives, to break artists, to break people’s spirits, and I do everything I can to break media.\nFrom my standpoint, sometimes I’ll think of things and maybe it’s two o’clock in the morning on Saturday night, and my wife will go, “Don’t tweet that. Do not tweet that.” Because people take things out of context, but you just do it, you don’t care.\nYou shoulda saw the second set of tweets…\nSave them for next time.\nI do just want to say congratulations on your new baby. In fact, I brought you a little gift. I made fun of this, but there really is such a thing as leather jogging pants, and there’s some tiny little leather jogging pants\nFashion isn’t always practical. It’s more about emotion, it’s more about swag. It’s more about, you know, pussy. It’s more about, like, club. It’s more about style and stuff.\nI remember me and my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision. We sat as interns at Fendi like six years ago. We had cue cards and everything, and the leather jogging pants is one of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the reason I brought that up in the Zane interview is because there are people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants. It became a phenomenon over the past three years. And it was to say, you know, I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head designer of Saint Laurent, and he’d say, “Stop giving these big brands your ideas and everything.” And it would just be like, what I was trying to express in the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I could put the proper production around them. So when do a Nike Yeezy or a Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around it was at the same level as the production on my CD, or when me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together. But if I go out and make my own t-shirt or something, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about when I just called myself a creative genius, and say “What’s so genius about this?” But when people line up for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is like really genius.” You need that production.\nBut currently in fashion and the way the fashion world works, there’s no black guy at the end of the runway in paris, in all honesty. And that’s what I was talking about when the Truman Show hit the boat.\nWhat about a Steve Harvey collection?\nYeah, no. There’s no Steve Harvey collection. No extra buttons on jackets or anything like that.\nBut for Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson had to fight to get his videos on MTV because he was considered to be “urban.” This is Michael Jackson.\nThat’s true. He was considered a Black artist and was not right for MTV at that time.\nYeah, a black artist. So, for me, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our outfits and all this, or people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names. Like stuff you can’t even say on TV. And I still can’t break that wall down. At a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson trying to get his videos on because, who do you know who’s known more for clothes than me? To not be able to do and produce to the highest level, and to have a meeting with everyone. I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy over here, this guy who runs this company, Leanne . These are the real people who produce the clothes that are on your back. Zara, out there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone. And everyone just sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like you don’t crash the Internet. And you’re just like, “How can you get a shot?” And then you try to do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for a rapper, and you just cannot overcome it.\nI mean, my grandfather drove the first cars in the marches just to get clean water, and one of the parallels I wanted to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to always talk about, he just wanted a clean plate. He just wanted to serve his stuff on a clean plate. So if I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they take all these classist shots at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I talked about.\nPaula Deen, she was old-school with it. They’re like, “We don’t do it like that anymore, Paula Deen. We’re classist now.” So this classism is what they do to try to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a reality show. You’re not up here with us. You know, we’re old money, we--\nIt’s snobbery--\nIt’s snobbery. And I’m not into all that snobbery. Because, you know what? We have the loudest voice, we have the loudest communication, and all we want to do is make awesome stuff. All we want is a real shot. Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt. No, I understand about quality. I understand about fabrics. I spent ten thousand hours at this. I’ve dedicated my life to this. And a lot of people say, “OK, you have to do music.” I’m gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened? What if people told me I couldn’t perform. I’m only 36 years old; I have other goals and other things. And I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and say, “I want to make something, I want to make the next Ralph Lauren.” That was the point of the Zane interview, to say, people don’t stand up to protect their dreams. People are too scared of getting, you know, spoofed in a way. \nAnd the irony of it is, think about a creative person in school. When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the way in the back of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m the one creative, and this is the reason why I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s moments when I stood up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing. Come and kill me. Do whatever you’re gonna do, but you’re not going to bully me, you’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.” No matter how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself! Stop seeing what you can do! Stop affirming what you’re gonna do and then completing that in real life.” That’s the improper way to do it. I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the way they control people with low self-esteem. With improper information, with branding, with marketing… I refuse to follow those rules.\nIt’s about truth, it’s about information, it’s about awesomeness, and the only luxury is time. The time you spend with your family, that’s the only luxury. So this concept of “luxury” is improper to me. You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a Vertu phone right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.” I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, just the quality of your life. This is what I’m here to do, so when I compare myself to Steve Jobs or Walt Disney, Howard Hughes, David Stern, Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Jesus of whatever it is, I’m saying, “These are my heroes. These are people I look up to. This is the type of impact I want to make on the earth.” If I can make this type of impact up to this point, what can I do, if you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, give him a shot.” If you call Oprah and say, “Yo, back this kid. This kid, his parents were educators. He wants to educate. He wants to look at curriculums and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”\nExactly what I did in music, I want to apply to product, I want to apply to education. This is what my company Donda is about. I could rap all I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain. I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t have made it to the point to make “Jesus Walks.” And now, even as a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling. And the way paparazzi talk to me and my family is disrespectful, also. We bring something of joy to the world. When people hear my music they have a good time. And I should be respected as such when I walk down the street. Don’t ask me a question about something you say in a tabloid. Don’t try to antagonize me. Cause, you know what, it’s not safe for you in this zoo. Never think that I’m not from Chicago for one second. And think you can walk right up and disrespect me and my family constantly.\nAnd people say, “Well, you signed up to be a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know what, and I understand paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, but let’s have respect for each other. You do help me get money, paparazzi, you show people how fresh my outfit is, that helps me influence people.\nBut when they show up at your house in the middle of the night, and your wife and your daughter are there, there’s no human decency there.\nIt’s a lack of decency.\nKanye West, everybody.",

"Stop it, stop it. Hey radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Yall dont want to lose again. A lot of people here tonight felt like they lost. You know why? Because y’all been lied to. Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you. Radio, fuck you! I know it’s a lot of real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over. And when I say that bullshit, what Im saying is we love Drake, Drake is great. He’s a great artist. But Frank Ocean is great, too. But you know who the greatest of all of us? Who do y’all think? Nope. Kid motherfucking Cudi. Radio, fuck you! Oh yeah, I’m on my Trump shit tonight. Radio, fuck you. Yeah, I’m taking his lead. I’mma just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win. I’mma take his lead. Radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Wait a second. Eh, is it, “Radio, fuck you? That’s what you’re saying?” Exactly\nNot fuck the people that work at radio because these is real people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to play that real shit because they think that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same shit over and over and over. I was raised by KMS 1, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was raised by DMX. The last real nigga alive? Naw, nigga! We real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh! We alive tonight, bruh! Virgil Abloh is alive tonight, bro. A$AP Nast is alive tonight, bro. Bari is alive tonight, bro. Ian Connor is alive tonight, bro. Rocky alive tonight, bro. Aye, y’all love my show. When I say these names, y’all better scream for me. I don’t give a fuck if you know the names or not, go ahead, Google them. They will give you a little bit of factual information. They will give you that. Why did I name A$AP? Because that’s the future. That’s the niggas they got me and Cudi on our toes like that. These these niggas keeping this shit alive bro, These these niggas keeping this shit alive bro. It’s life\nWe’ve got a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this planet, bro, and we can have a utopia. We can love each other. But the rules gotta be fair. Khaled and Drake and radio and Doc and 92.3 and everybody. Is it just me or did you hear that song so many times “you say you wanna play for free.” Aye, aye. You know what it is, though? Because aye, I love Drake. I love Khaled. But they set that song up, bro. And let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you! Once again, as always. I’m on my Trump shit tonight. Let me tell you what it is, bruh. Aye, you know me. I went down seven years of my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best video. Hey, baby, let’s rock and roll tonight. Y’all might be experiencing a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back. The prodigal son, Kid Cudi, has returned. The vibes is back. I know it’s going to be a lot of conversations after tonight\nKhaled, I know you got killers in Miami, please do not send them at my head. I just want to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga. You got the keys. But as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing for years. Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this and still win. He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro. Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro\nSo, when I talk about MTV, let me explain something. I was hurt, Beyoncé, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called “Fade” and out of respect MTV told me, \"Mr. West out of respect to you, I will let you know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”\" They told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage. Ayy bro, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision and you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you. Beyoncé, I was hurt. I went down seven years on behalf of your—eh, nigga! Don’t throw no shit while Im talking. I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I talk to y’all like this. This is a moment in the The Matrix, bro. The vibes is back. The vibes is back. Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight. Beyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over “Hotline Bling.” In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to diss Beyoncé. She is great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal, but sometimes, we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh!\nI’ve been sent here to give y’all my truth, even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I’ve been sent here to give y’all the truth. Jay Z, call me, bruh. You still ain’t call me. Jay Z, call me. Aye bruh, I know you got killers, please don’t send them at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man. I’m not trying to be \"the man\", I just am \"a man\", the same as anybody here. I ain’t above, below none of y’all. We all equal. We all equal. These is the vibes, bro. This is the future. This is the way of thinking to Make America Great Again. Ha! You didn’t like that! Guess what? Guess what? Y’all need the vibes. I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro. The way motherfuckers put money up so high, popularity, radio spins. Feelings matter, bro. Feelings matter, bro\nIt’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world. Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro. It’s a new world. It’s a new world, Barack! It’s a new world, Jay Z! Aye, don’t send killers at my head, bro! This ain’t the Malcolm X movie, we growing from that moment. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye! Oh wait a second. Do y’all agree with that? Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye! Wait a second - I ain’t hear enough screams on that. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye!\nPeople Im not saying this out of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of my own well-being to say things like this. Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of motherfucking times. Y’all motherfuckers is behind the times. Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the most relevant shit happening. The Saint Pablo tour is more relevant than radio! And if y’all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clintond. You might not like it, but they gotta hear it. I ain’t here to massage you with a fake truth, telling you that Hillary gon’ win over and over and over, then you wake up you still can’t believe it! You know why? Because you was lied to by Google! You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg!\nMark Zuckerberg, you wanna call me now? Do I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg? Was you wrong? When I said I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, was you wrong? You ate dinner, you asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have dinner with me. I told you about DONDA. You said you would help and you didn’t. Then you went to look for aliens. Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro. The vibes is back. Ayy John - Take it all the way back to the beginning. Shia LaBeouf, Kid Cudi feels a way, give him a call\nQ-Tip, I love you, bro, don’t tell me how to be me, though. I love you. The Tribe album is dope. I love you. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I’ve been me. I am me. There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the power. That’s happened with musicians because they’re scared. I’m not scared. I’m here to change things. I am here to change things. And things wont change until people admit they own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That’s what I’ve been blessed with, my vision. I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I’m going to say how I feel. Right now, I will prepare - right now, press get ready to write your passive-aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season 4, racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press! Get ready, get ready, cause the show’s over.",

"You send things out on Twitter and sometimes, like Kim has said -- and I’ll tell you this also, I don’t know if she’s told you this along with not wanting more children -- but Kim has said…\nI’m fine to just practice.\nThat’s all you get to do. Kim said there should be a board of directors that goes through your tweets. Like, when you have an idea you give them to Kim and a bunch of people and they go, \"Okay, you can tweet that\" or \"No, you cannot tweet that.\" Do you think you should have a board of directors?\nAbsolutely not.\nNo?\nYeah.\nEverything you tweet, you think – have you regretted anything you’ve tweeted?\nNope.\nNothing, never? You don’t go, \"Maybe I should have thought about that a little longer\"?\nWhat’s the point of thinking?\n\"What’s the point of thinking…\" Well, sometimes I understand, but sometimes there is a point to thinking. And then you tweeted out that you want Mark Zuckerberg to give you $53 million. In hindsight, should of that have gone on Facebook?\nYes.\nYes.\nI couldve put that on Facebook, now I understand why he didn’t hit me back.\nYeah.\nI understand that Zuckerberg doesn’t use Twitter.\nYeah.\nEven though I have had dinner with him and his wife and told them about how I wanted to help the world and he said he’d help me and then blah, blah, bla, like... and that’s how it feels though, you know? It’s like the pursuit of happiness, like it’s like, you’re trying to sell this bone density machine or something. You know, like in that movie. I feel that if I had more resources, I could help more people. I have ideas that can make the human race existence, within our 100 years, better. Period.\nFuck the paparazzi, whatever perception you have of me, starting with the truth, starting with- starting with what everyone’s thinking. Start there... put some dope shit with it.\nOk, I’m with you on –\nYe is in the building! Put your motherfucking hands in the air right now! Put your hands in the air right now! Yeah, okay.\nI’m with you on the truth part. When you say put some dope shit with it. Give me one example, the ideas, cause maybe someone watching will give you the money.\nWe’re in a renaissance period. We’re in a place where people are, like, multi-disciplined artists. Like Steve McQueen that directed 12 Years a Slave; he was considered to just be a photographer, but then he won an Oscar. We’re not in a place where people can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life. So the exact amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything I put into my music, I put them into shoes and they worked.\nYou know, people never write, \"Kanye’s pissing everybody off.\" They try to position that through the media in some way that I’m like, \"Whatever.\" Whatever your friends might say, you know, \"I saw Kanye.\" \"How was he? Did he…?\" I care about people. I care about– my dad lived in homeless shelters less than five years ago to find out he’s a psych major. My mom was the first black female chair of the English department at Chicago State University. I was raised to do something, to make a difference.\nTo take– you know, I didn’t take the Oscars as a joke. It was funny. You know what I’m saying, it was like the moment. All black actors can talk about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this town. And this is the moment. \"You get your night. Go ahead. Chris Rock is going to do it, bam! Talk about how many times you’ve been blocked from being able to excel.\"\nI didn’t take it as a joke. \"It ain’t no joke,\" as Rakim said. It ain’t no joke. \"I used to let the mic smoke, now I slam it and make sure it’s broke.\" That’s what I was raised on – Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip-hop, expression. \"Hip hop started out in the park…\"\nEverybody’s trying to… I don’t give a fuck how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio. Are you connecting? Picasso is dead. Steve Jobs is dead. Walt Disney is dead. Name somebody living that you can name in the same breath as them. Don’t tell me about being likable.\nWe got 100 years here. We’re one race, the human race, one civilization. We’re a blip in the existence of the universe, and we constantly try to pull each other down. Not doing things to help each other. That’s my point. It’s like I’m shaking talking about it. I know it’s daytime TV, but I feel I can make a difference while I’m here. I feel that I can make things better through my skill set. Through my skills– I’m an artist. Five years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute of Chicago. I am an artist. I have a condition called synesthesia where I see sounds. I see them. Everything that I sonically make is a painting. I see it. I see the importance– I see the importance in the value of everyone being able to experience a more beautiful life.\nWhen I make clothes… It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Obama and Leo’s talking about the environment and I’m talking about clothes and everyone looks at me like, \"That’s not an important issue.\" But I remember going to school in fifth grade and wanting to have a cool outfit. I called the head of Payless. I’m like, \"I want to work with you.\" I want to take all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in all these fashion shows and knocking on all these doors and buying all these expensive clothes, and I want to take away bullying.\nYou know, I want to- Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the reason I was able to go so far in music. There was a time when Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he was considered to be \"urban.\" The Michael Jackson. So I literally have to be Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break open the doors of everyone that will come after I’m gone. After I’m dead. After they call me \"Wacko Kanye.\"\nIsn’t that so funny? That people point fingers at the people who have influenced us the most. They talk the most shit about the people who cared the most. I’m sorry, daytime television. I’m sorry for the realness.\nWell, it’s not daytime television anymore. We’re going to take a break and we are going to come back, we’re going to play 5 Second Rule, which should be very fun with Kanye.",

"Raf Simons is the future. Still the future. The 40-year-old Belgian designer has long been the headlight for radical menswear. Throughout the 90s and 00s, his eponymous label showed how innovative design can embrace new technologies and fabrics and rethink traditional structures. In 2005, Simons turned from rogue independent to the man behind a megabrand, taking the reins of the mens and womens lines at Jil Sander. That label has always been known for its clean, utilitarian silhouettes, a precision that seems to particularly suit Simons, who, for the Fall 2008 womenswear collection, put the tailors on the dresses and the dressmakers on the tailoring. It was Simons way of again unsettling how we think of clothes\nSimons has many fans well beyond the closed doors of high fashion. Take Kanye West, the hip-hop superstar who has pretty much restyled the music world over the past few years. Hes never hidden his interest in fashion. When West went looking for inspiration in developing his upcoming sportswear line, Pastelle, he had the good sense to check out Simons. Their upbringings couldnt have been more different, but Simons and West are both fearless individualists. Here they talk about style, music, and why its good to be the outsider on the playground. We started off asking them what they were like as children\nRAF SIMONS: I was born in this very small village in Belgium. It wasnt really a creative environment. In school, creating was kept away from young people. The village was so small there was no outlet except for one little record store. I think that is where it started for me-just picking up records. Im 40 years old, so it was LPs. The first LP I ever bought—youre going to be shocked—was Bob Marley. Then I switched to Kraftwerk, Joy Division, and that kind of stuff. I was a bit dark at that time because I felt so isolated. But not only me, there were some other young people who felt that way. We loved to dress in black. I was growing up in the New Wave period, but that wasnt allowed in school. I remember moments when they wouldnt let four people dressed in black stand together on the playground. Then, before I graduated, I remember finding this book, and there was one page about industrial design. Basically, I ended up going to school for that. At that time there was a big boom going on with fashion in Belgium. The more I looked, the more I became interested. Before that I never even thought to become a fashion designer or anything like that. I started feeling that work when I was 19 years old, but I didnt do my first collection until I was 27. I wanted to finish my education in industrial design first. My parents are very holy to me. They never said, \"You should do this,\" or \"You should do that.\" My dad had to go in the army when he was 16, and he stayed there. My mom was a cleaning lady her whole life. The only thing they said to me was: \"Take it seriously. Do what you what you believe in, but take it seriously.\" So the fourth year, I had to go for an internship. I went to Walter Van Beirendonck. I knocked on his door, and I was super scared-because I had nothing to do with fashion. But he was interested. He had absolutely zero interest in all of the fashion work I had faked to impress him. He just went straight to my industrial-design stuff. He said, \"I really want you to come because, next to the fact that I am a fashion designer, I have this presentation in Paris and objects to make. Im not a traditional designer.\" I ended up doing that with him, and he took me to Paris, and I saw my first show, which was the third show for Martin Margiela. Nothing else in fashion has had such a big impact on me. It was a show where half the audience cried, including myself. I was just like, \"What! This is fashion?\" Only at that point did I understand what fashion could be or what it could mean to people. It was the \"white\" show, where all the models wore dresses in white and transparent plastic. Margiela had no money at the time, so the Maison ended up going to a black neighborhood in Paris and asking if they could use a childrens playground for the show. The parents said, \"Yes, you can have the playground, but we want our children to be able to see it.\" So little black children were standing with the audience in the front row. The children started to run over to the models, and they picked them up and held them around their necks\nKANYE WEST: For me, I realized the psychology behind having Jordans growing up—what it meant culturally, or what it meant to be a child just trying to fit in. When my parents divorced, my mother moved to Chicago, and my father stayed in Maryland. My mother lived in an all-black neighborhood. My father lived in an all-white neighborhood. When I got to Maryland, I had to adjust to a more affluent neighborhood than what I was used to in Chicago. Then when I went back to Chicago, I had to readjust to that. Then my mother and I moved to China for a year when I was in fifth grade. I had to adjust to a place where there was nobody my age, not to mention any black kids out there. Those were scary situations, but it made me able to open up my mind to other cultures and be accepting. And that is the greatest blessing, to have those experiences, because I can adapt to other cultures and still be who I am. So you see, with my style, there is a bit of Paris and a bit of Japan and a bit of the suburbs. A lot of peoples style looks very specific to one region\nRS: Thats very good. Having your feet in the middle, you can see everything very differently. I think its beyond fantastic, actually. Dress codes and gestures and attitudes have always inspired me, as has youth culture in general, although now I question it more. If you analyze youth cultures over history, there has always been something strict about them-you have to be like this or like that. Im actually surprised that in the 21st century, it can still be so present: They are still environments with walls around them\nKW: What Ive noticed in the last few months, especially since my mom passed, is that everything is a cult. I dont mean cult in a bad way, just that everythings been cultivated for us. New ideas are the new roads, the dirt roads, that people have to pave. In order to go through the dirt roads, you have to get scratched with sticks, and you end up dirty if you have any new concepts. America is made not to have new concepts. Its there to live alongside strip malls and be beaten by mundaneness. Even hip-hop is: \"You cant do this, you cant say that. These are the rules of hip-hop.\" One of my friends, Ludacris, wanted me to make a song called \"Did It for Hip-Hop.\" On the song I was gonna talk about how I didnt do anything for hip-hop-I did it for myself. I did subscribe to the cult of hip-hop at one point, and I am very hip-hop because of it. But I have a lot of ideas that extend way further than the rules of hip-hop. In Japan you see guys that are dressed completely hip-hop, but theyre completely nice also. Theyll come up to you, looking like theyll rob you and instead they bow. I find a lot of similarities between myself and the Japanese, because sometimes they look at something from the outside, and take the best of what they like about it, and then theyll work extremely hard at pushing it to another level. Theyll take a piece of Americana, like jeans, buy all the jean mills, and then be the master at those jeans. From a music standpoint, I stayed in Chicago, where theres no music industry, no outlets, nobody else that can make beats with me, not on the level of New York. Whereas in New York, everyone knew one another-you could be a small producer and sell a beat really quickly. So I would work on the beat so much that by the time I got to New York, the ones I was making were way better than anyone elses. They were like, \"Damn! Your beats sound like theyre completed songs!\" Cause people would just do beats that were a sample, like a really basic idea. Then theyd have a keyboard player come in, a person whos a specialist at drums, and an engineer. And Im doing all this in my room, right next to my mother, trying to beat five producers, taking the entire summer off, not getting a haircut, not getting any new shoes, cause I couldnt afford them—and its like what Japanese people do: They see it and they end up doing it way better than the culture that made it. You once told me that if you didnt do fashion, you would have done psychology\nRS: I like to find out things about people. Im interested in them. But part of being a psychiatrist is also having to find out about people you dont have an interest in\nKW: Right. Thats the problem. Whenever you take a job that you think youre gonna love, theres gonna be situations like that, where you also have to work with people who youre not as interested in, until you get to the point where youre at the very top of your game and you can just be like, \"No, I dont want to do this at all.\" Until then, you havent reached your ultimate goal in life—a lot of people dont realize that the ultimate goal in life is to not have to do anything you dont want to do. Most people think the solution is to make a lot of money. The only problem is some people fall into the trap where money becomes the prison, and they end up having to do a bunch of things that they dont want to do for money to get that couple weeks of vacation where they feel like theyre not doing anything they dont want to do. So, for me, I try to design my life like its a big vacation every single day, every moment of my life. Thats the goal. Like, I wouldnt rather be doing anything more right now than talking on the phone with Raf Simons, one of my idols and someone Ive studied so much. I was in a Jil Sander store for an hour yesterday, looking at the collars and studying the way the marble print was put on the sweaters\nRS: That means a lot to me, and thats also why I continue to do what I do. For me, I think that the 21st century almost doesnt allow the beauty of something really small and out of the spotlight. I deal now with two labels, my own, which is a very small label, and Jil, which is a very big, corporate business label. I see the difference, and every day I work there I think, What is now best for me?—because I like both very much. My own mentality is to make it small, like my own environment. In that sense I relate to what you were saying because I enjoy just working with my people every day. But our society doesnt allow that. Our society wants things to grow, and our society wants things to become bigger and bigger. Everything has to be put under the spotlight\nKW: Where I came from in Chicago, we didnt have the term hip-hop. People didnt even know how to state the way I dressed or acted and what my mannerisms were. Its like how you said there were only a few people who dressed in black. I cant even think of one person in my school who dressed like me. There are new boxes and barriers that Im breaking down every day. Coming from the hip-hop community, one of the things that youre never allowed to do is to speak about gay people unless youre disrespecting them. You couldnt be friends with gay people, you couldnt be in the car with them, you had to look at them in a completely different way, like they werent even real people. I was working with my interior decorator, which was a big step for me because he was gay and I would have to ride in a car to go pick out fabrics and furniture. And Id always think, What if a picture of me got shot and they put it on the Internet and they all said thats my boyfriend? Then in hip-hop, they would be like, \"Oh, Kanyes gay, so we cant listen to his raps because he broke a rule of hip-hop.\"\nRS: You break them, and you keep on breaking them, I would say\nKW: Yeah. Now that Ive broken that, I feel much freer that I can be creative and not deal with stereotypes. America beats stereotypes into people. Recently there was this whole Bonnaroo situation. I didnt realize that actual racism was still alive, because at a certain point, once you become famous, youre no longer black or white, youre just green-youre just money. So when you walk in any store theres a certain level of: \"Oh, hes not a black guy. Hes a famous guy now!\" When I went to that Bonnaroo festival in Tennessee, they definitely reminded me that I was a black guy. On 12 port-a-potties they wrote in bold letters fuck kanye. They didnt allow my crew to load on the stage; the promoter allowed Pearl Jam to do three encores. The sun was starting to come up, and the whole point of my show was that it was glow in the dark. They bled my cryo tanks so I wouldnt have smoke. I felt so naïve, cause it clicked in my head: Oh, wow, this is really done on purpose\nRS: Being popular, is it something you want?\nKW: I wrestle with it every day, because you still have to figure out how to use it in a good way. Its like a girl being beautiful. It can be a gift or a curse. Its like you could be one step away from being Kurt Cobain. Or you could be like Ralph Lauren, where you take your influence and help paint the world. Basically, I work constantly on coming up with ideas to paint the world\nRS: I wonder if you still find it necessary to dress a certain way when you perform. Im just thinking back in time, when there were performers that constantly created revolutions. Thats how it started for me, you know? The musicians I was interested in I liked even more because they were such amazing chameleons. You have people such as David Bowie. In a way, I could compare him to you. You are a 21st-century boy, you know? I mean, Bowie goes to Berlin, and 9,000 people go to his concert expecting him to look like Ziggy Stardust, and he looked like the Thin White Duke. If youre interested in popularity, its also very clear in todays society, that that is the way to make yourself popular, because changing is ultimate freedom\nKW: Well, thats who I am now. When I delivered the \"Flashing Lights\" video-where the girl was very, very voluptuous, as opposed to what was always on TV, and a very instantly-would-get-somebodys-dick-hard type girl-Im like, \"This is what I grew up on, and these are the type of girls that I like.\" And then I mixed it. I juxtaposed super-huge titties with Margiela shoulder pads, which had never been done, with a Ford Mustang in the middle of the desert. Then I juxtaposed voice-over rapping, where Im not in the video at all, and then I get killed at the end-its like, I dont give a fuck what people want from this record, this is the idea that I want to show. And then after that I went onstage and designed a stage show where I was the only person. I dont think I could have been in the place to really say, \"Fuck what the ideas were before, what people expect of me,\" if I didnt have that situation with my mother, that great loss. Because when you suffer a big loss like I did, its like, What else can you lose? The reason why people are always scared is theyre afraid of losing whatever it is they have. And I think, in life, people want happiness, and they want a bit of their self-esteem back. People are so scared to lose their worldly possessions. So as an entertainer, am I gonna say something where I get so much backlash that I lose everything, that I lose the ability to sell records, that I lose the ability to keep a lifestyle? For me, I wouldnt care if I died broke. I wouldnt. Id rather give my kids the same ability that I had, to hustle and to create their own way, than to leave them money\nRS: So how are you going to solve that? \nKW: I just do exactly what I want to do, just like you do. Jil Sander-okay, Ill just give away one of my main ideas for my clothes. One of the bases for the finishes for my label is the lack of finishing. It should be theatrical. The fabrics should be great. But no gold zippers. I say \"Jil Sander,\" like, about 25 times a day when Im talking to my design team-\nRS: Im scared now, Kanye. But I often have a worry in fashion that you can do it a different way only until a certain point, and then youll just be kicked out. In fashion you try to change something, try to make people also think about what it is, and not just try to produce and produce and produce for business. Fashion as a creative art is always seen as something that is ahead, but only because its so sped up. I think it will become only more and more complicated, along with all other creative outlets-\nKW: I have this conversation all the time about the arts, how they are commercialized—especially rap music, at a certain point, when it got so big and there were, like, super-megastars who couldnt rap at all, and they were making so much money. At that point, thats when hip-hop started to die. That took it down a level. Like in Middle America, youre not allowed to have any art in your clothing. You cant be expressive, or people will start talking about you\nRS: Do you define yourself as a rapper?\nKW: Yeah. As a joke, whenever I go through customs and have to fill out what my occupation is, I put rapper, because its almost looked down upon. I used to put rapper on my applications to get a job; the manager would pull me to the side and say, \"Man, Im gonna just tell you—for real, you shouldnt put rapper on your application.\" So now, because of that, I always put rapper\nRS: I never feel I am a fashion designer. I have even found it problematic that the world defines me as a fashion designer. To me its more like, Yes, it is what I do now, but its far from my only interest, and I could see myself doing so many other things than fashion. It gives me a certain kind of fear for the future. If I have the interest to change to a very different field, Im scared people couldnt see me like that anymore because they define me as a fashion designer. I find it very intense, fashion. At one time I was doing only menswear. I was also creating art and teaching at university-that was all combinable. But, you know, once you have a label where you deal with mens and womens and you do six runway shows a year-accessories, campaigns, et cetera-theres a lot less space. I think its different when musicians enter fashion. A lot of those collections are done by teams. Maybe a music performer is over-viewing, or the music performer is the name-carrier of the brand. It seems to me like its a side career. There are rappers who start a brand, and then it looks \"rap.\" The way that I design now, its coming out of me, so theres a lot from me, but it doesnt look like me at all. I see it as my responsibility to take it very far away from me. Even my own brand became an abstraction. I think thats the only way to refresh it and keep it interesting for a big audience, because what you yourself are representing, its only for a very small group of people. The bigger the brand, the bigger the responsibility, because you have to think of all these kinds of different cultures, different environments, different people, different psychologies . . \nKW: The psychology is really important. When I bring up my own clothing line now, it has to be a practical joke, because I havent brought it out yet. But the thing is, as Im working on it, Ive learned a lot of the different things that youre saying about a line being too connected and saying: \"Okay, this is a line, and it has to have its own voice. It has to represent something thats not out there.\" And as I speak on it right now, my words have no weight. People read this in Interview magazine, your words will be in peoples minds in bold, and my words, when I bring up clothing or designing, will be in light gray and \"Get the fuck out of here, you rapper,\" until I do something that is basically the opposite of everything that you just said\nRS: Maybe we should start something together. Maybe you should buy my brand, and together well go do something completely different. Maybe thats what should change. Because thats also what the future is going to be about, its going to be all crossovers, everywhere, finally. I was criticized in the past, believe me. I was criticized because I touched all the fields and had an interest in all of them. But I think that now is going to be the time of crossovers, especially in fashion-more than in other fields. A general thing that I feel so strongly is that the fashion audience is bored so quickly. They are bored sometimes even before they see a show. It is not something I blame the audience for—I try to find solutions. I try to keep their attention, because I want their attention. Dont ask me why, but I want it. I dont want the attention on me as a person. I could never do what you do; I am not a performer. It makes me nervous and scared. But I really need that attention-because Im proud, because I believe I have something to say. And the problem is were going to have so many crossovers that people are going to be bored with those crossovers in one day. Thats something that Im really questioning. Is the motivation business? Is the motivation to keep the audience interested? Are we going to come to a point where the new is not going to be able to be new anymore? Because its such an important word in fashion, the word new. And it makes me think a lot, because I deal with one brand that has always tried to be about the new and that has always been dealing with coherence. Jil Sander has always been a very coherent brand. Jil as a person had no desire to be in the middle point of the fashion arena to catch attention. But I see, also, that the audience is in this moment looking for that. It is something you have to deal with if you are responsible for a business, and you will be criticized and adored. You cannot have adoration without -being criticized\nKW: Yeah. Well, right now its just criticism. No, its not criticism, its pessimism. Im not anywhere near as well-off as people would think for how big my name is, because I put everything back into the album, into recording. I put everything into investing and doing an independent clothing line because I refuse to do a licensing deal where people are like, \"Put your name on the front of this shirt, and this is what you do . . . \"\nRS: I know what it is to go somewhere where you havent been, and a whole arena is sitting there with lions waiting for the meat to come in. I know exactly the feeling I had when I had to go to Jil Sander and I had never done womenswear. Its a challenge. But its fantastic. I like the idea of constantly changing, like a chameleon. But its complicated. Fashion, just like music, deals so intensely with new generations of people who come in and really appreciate change. But in music, even if youve been in the business for 50 years, you stand on the stage, and you do that song from 50 years ago, and the audience will love that same song-they will respect it and respect you for it. In fashion, its not like that. I cannot go onstage and bring out the same collection from 10 years ago. That wouldnt work. I would be dead",
"Don’t let nobody tell you what you can do, what you can believe, what you can achieve. Don’t let nobody but you\nYou know, people be looking at me like I got a problem or something. Like I’m uncontrollable or something. Like I don’t do what I’m supposed to do. You know it’s like they want to have everybody so brainwashed. They want to control everybody, you know, rumors, lies, media, marketing. It’s like they want to steal you from you, and sell you back to you after they stole it. They want to make you feel like you less than who you really are\nCuz as far as I’m concerned everybody’s a star. See they want to make you feel like you less than you really are. Cuz as far as I’m concerned everybody’s a star\nYou know, uh, the first thing they do is crush your dreams. Crush your dreams. Then add a couple drops of low self-esteem. And then I don’t think everything is what it seems. And control you with lies. And control you with lies\nYou know Imma tell you something, first thing they do is crush your dreams. Then let’s add a couple, a couple of drops of low esteem. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. We goin’ out of control tonight. We goin’ out of control tonight. Ahh\nHow many people tonight with a show of hands think they are fucking awesome? \nNow with a show of hands: How many people tonight have had people tell you your whole life that you wasn’t fucking awesome? \nSee this is what I’m talking about.This is what I’m talking about. This is what I’m talking about. I mean, this is what I’m talking about, this is what I’m talking about\nHow many people tonight have ever talked to somebody right, that you know they’ll say, I don’t know what’s wrong with Kanye or make it seem like I’m a bad person in some way, right? Now what have I ever done that was so wrong other than believe in myself? Now believing in yourself is so, so, so wrong that the other side is so, so, so, so strong, they’re trying to beat down and demonize and dishumanize — I don’t know if that’s a word or not, but it’s now a word, cuz I said it’s a fucking word — and try to dishumanize people who believe in themselves. Cuz then what happens? Then you believe in yourself. And then you believe in yourself and you believe anything is possible. How many people believe that what they dream about, what y’all want to do, whether you want to be a doctor or lawyer, a designer, a musician, video-game programmer, a lighting guy, a manager … how many people want to contribute something to the world?\nYou see, I know you all might have seen some of my interviews and seen me on TV, but what I was saying the whole time is, what I was saying the whole time is, cuz I’m not — making it lighter, make it lighter, the second, the second light — I’m not particularly angry or anything like that, but what I’m saying is, they taking the idea of celebrity and trying to make me seem I was stupid or something. You know, when I take these meanings and shit, people they talk to you like you’re stupid or something. And then you look back and say, you know, like I’m not gonna call no names out, I’m not going to mention Nike or nothing like that. I’m not going to say no names or anything\nBut if you’re a creative and you want to create, and you just want to create more, this is exactly what I’ve been fighting for. So if you hear me talking about Louis Vuitton or the Gucci Group or anything like that. I’m not dissing Louis Vuitton, I’m not dissing the Gucci Group and shit. I’m just saying, don’t discriminate against me, because I’m a black man or because I’m a celebrity, and tell me that I can create, but not feel. Cuz you know damn well there aren’t no black guys or celebrities making no Louis Vuitton nothing. They let Pharrell make those glasses, and we liked them, right? They let me make those shoes, and we liked them right?\nAnd they say, “No, no, no, nigga. Not no more. That’s too much. That’s too much. No, no, no, no, no, no, nigga not no more. That’s way too much. That’s way too much. Stay in your place. Sit in the front of that show and wear this jacket I made you. Stay in your place. Do what you get paid to do. Stay in your place. Don’t embarrass yourself trying to chase your dreams. Save face. Save face.”\nThat’s why I got this fucking mask on, cuz I ain’t worried about saving face. Fuck my face! Let’s set ‘em off. Pause. Now they finally got a headline. But fuck whatever my face is supposed to mean! Fuck whatever Kanye is supposed to mean! It’s about my dreams. It’s about everybody’s dreams. It’s about creating. It’s not about the idea of being a fucking celebrity, it’s not about the idea of a black man trying to do fashion and shit. Cuz these walls that I break down, these walls that I break down and we will\nAnd I’m arguing with my friend Spike Jonze in the car cuz he said, Kanye, what you need to say is you’re gonna try. You’re gonna try to break them down. Don’t say you’re just going to do it. And I said, I am gonna do it! I told Kim seven years ago, I’m gonna marry you! And I’m telling you right now as I stand on this stage, all this shit that you heard me talking about, I’m gonna come and back all that shit up. You don’t know how hard it was to get the Nikes, that wasn’t my fault. They try to control y’all and try to control me. And when I was in my negotiations, they told me, “We don’t negotiate with celebrities.” That’s like a terrorist. They talk to you like it’s fucking terrorist\nYou know, I just want to make something awesome. I just want to be awesome, and I want to hang around my awesome friends and change the fucking world, and that’s exactly what I plan to do. And if you plan to do the same, put your hands in the air right now. If you just want to be awesome and make awesome shit and change the fucking world and this is what you plan to do\nLet’s have a toast for the douchebags\nSource: Vulture",

"Zane Lowe: Grab a seat, grab a seat. So, you remember this place? Graduation? I was also thinking about some of the other things weve done as well with the BBC, like Abbey Road sprung to mind with the strings.\nKanye West: Oh yeah. That was good. That suit was like, I wouldve worn something different if I could look back right now. I could still do a suit, I just wouldnt have done that exact lapel situation.\nZL: But talk about really putting yourself on the line with that. That was so early on for you to be stepping in a room with that many players and to give yourself that objective. What are your thoughts when you think back about Abbey Road, where...its just nuts.\nKW: I thought it was good. I thought it was what I was supposed to do at that time. If I see something, if I see an opportunity, Im gonna go for it. Were all gonna die one day.\nZL: Yeah, thats true.\nKW: So live like that. Live like you could die tomorrow. Go for it. Those steps have been the platforms that allowed me to make it this far.\nZL: And you have, man, and youre here. Six original albums of your own, a Throne record, various records with G.O.O.D. Music to talk about. But seriously, man, Yeezus. Bravo, dude. I mean, that is one of the most creative records of any genre Ive heard in a very, very long time, and just in terms of your output, your most exciting-sounding record, I think.\nKW: Oh, thank you very much. Yeah, I feel I was able to start making exactly what was in my mind again, not having to speak with the textures of the time. Cause, you know, Cruel Summer is definitely Kanye West, and theres something weird and kind of off about \"Mercy,\" like when it has the high-pitched , that type of sound. It sounds like art still a little bit, even though it obviously was a radio smash.\nBut when I get into the idea, the trap drums and things like that, certain songs that are blatant radio hits, its like Im speaking with todays textures. If you look at it 200 years from now, its not going to stand out in the way that 808s or Yeezus stands out, and can completely push or redefine or make people say, hey, I completely hate that, or I completely love that, but let me just think differently. Because everybody is bound to these -- no pun intended -- theyre bound to sixteen bars or eight bars, and the normal radio thing.\nI was talking to Frank Ocean about this, and said, my mom got arrested for the sit-ins, and now were more like the sit-outs. Like, sit off of radio, and say, hey radio, come to us. We need to find something new, because its being controlled in a way, and manufactured in a way, that really awesome artists can make amazing music and not break as far past as, like, something thats very formulaic.\nZL: So it almost feels like a duty to you in a weird way? Having the peoples ear, having peoples attention for great music, to be able to say, well, if Im not challenging them enough, Im not challenging myself, not challenging radio, what am I doing?\nKW: Yeah. Im not trying to regurgitate myself. I showed people that I understand how to make perfect. Dark Fantasy could be considered to be perfect. I know how to make perfect. But thats not what Im here to do. Im here to crack the pavement and make new grounds, sonically and society, culturally.\nZL: Youve done that with Yeezus. Its fascinating for us to sit here and talk about this record now, because normally when I talk to artists about records of this nature, its in the lead-up to something. So were all kind of playing a guessing game, you know what I mean? You could tell me what you think of the record, but Im trying to find my way around it, the audience probably wont have heard it. In this case, its been out for a minute, so we can reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight, too. Youve seen what everyone else has had to say about this record, both good and bad. But Im fascinated to know, today, how you would describe Yeezus, as someone who made it. How you would describe that record.\nKW: I just think that Im a production person, Im a product guy, Im a producer. So if Im working on a John Legend album, Im gonna try to give John Legend the best home for him to stay in. And Im gonna try to push Pusha T -- no pun intended once again, this keeps happening to me -- to make the thing that represents what I like about his music the most. And then for me as Kanye West, I gotta fuck shit up.\nZL: And you did, dude, seriously. From the minute it starts. I mean, seriously. . Its disgusting.\nSo youre up in the loft probably at this point, and youre kicking around ideas, and youre putting things together, and this sound comes into your head, and youre like, this is what Im looking for?\nKW: Nah. This is me going to the studio with Thomas and Guy-Manuel, whos Daft Punk. They had a synthesizer the size of that wall right there. This is just one session right here. This beat was originally like 14 minutes long, and that part in the beginning was something we completely just distorted, and I ended up making that the intro.\nZL: You know, I got a beef with you over this track. Its too short! I wanted more out of it. Cause its one of the best beats on the record for me, and it feels like youre just getting warmed up. Was that kind of deliberate, to pull back after only a couple of verses and go, you know what, were going to get on with the album now?\nKW: Nah, its just what I felt, like it should be.\nZL: Just a dance thing.\nKW: And you know, originally \"Blood on the Leaves\" was supposed to be first.\nZL: Wow.\nKW: Which, psychologically, I know would have changed certain Yeezus naysayers about the album. It wasnt that time for me. I didnt want to come up there and perform. A lot of times, music can be presented as a service position. But I wanted to take a more aggressive approach with music.\nYou know, people go on a vacation and say, you got the drugs, you got the music, you got the wine? Its in that territory. But I wanted to speak up and say, okay, so my voice is only compressed to express myself artistically through music. Its the only place where I actually have a deal, so I can only consistently make things in music. So Im gonna take music and Im gonna try to make it three-dimensional, like on Star Wars and the hologramll pop up out of R2D2. Im gonna try to make something that jumps up and affects you, in a good or bad way. Whether its, Im going into a scream in the middle of the track because thats just the way I feel. But Im not here to make easy listening, easy programmable music.\nZL: No. Youre so off the reservation on this album in the best possible way. Like you talked about, the way you use your voice in different ways, you dont rely on conventional rhyming flows. Your opening line, \"Yeezus season approaching,\" you know? \"A monsters awoken.\" Youre laying it out there, this isnt My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy part 2. Im wilding out on this record, straight away.\n. And then from nowhere as well, we just get treated to these wonderful moments where, like you say, its almost like a collage. Like youre sitting here going, you know, why cant I go into this? Why not?\nKW: You can.\nZL: And you did.\nKW: Thats how life is. Its like a car crash. You could just be driving, and just out of nowhere it happens.\nZL: At what point did that very deliberate feel to the record, whereby breaks come in and join this really discordant electronic moments and everything seems to exist in this very contradictory but it works kind of way, at what point did that start to take shape? Because it is very omnipresent through the record as a whole, the way it flips between one and the other. Was that in your head early on, or did that come towards the end when you started to reduce the record?\nKW: Well, I didnt reduce it. Rick Rubin reduced it. Hes not a producer, hes a reducer. .\nZL: But was it always part of the process for you, to say, why dont I take elements of this and this and just bolt it together?\nKW: Yeah. Its just the way I was consuming information in my life at the time. Negative information to positive information, from the Internet, just going to the Louvre, going to furniture exhibits and understanding that, trying to open up and do interviews like this, learning more about architecture. Taking one thousand meetings, attempting to get backing to do clothing and different things like that. Getting no headway whatsoever. It was just that level of frustration. This is what frustration fucking sounds like.\nThis is what frustration sounds like. For me, as Kanye West, I would not be Kanye West if it wasnt for Michael Jackson. I was with Quincy Jones a couple days ago at John Legends wedding. Quincy was telling me, it wasnt just Mike, but these guys broke down the barriers. Of course you know Michael Jackson, he had to fight to get his video played because he was black. This is Michael Jackson. Michael Jacksons not even black, hes Michael Jackson -- you know what I mean? Hes so crazy, how can he even be classified as this black artist?\nSo for me, in my life and creativity its been challenging and everything. But I was able to ascend to massive heights because of the foundation that my mother and my father and my grandfather laid through civil rights, what Michael Jackson did with music videos and the ground he broke. There would be no Kanye West if it wasnt for Michael Jackson - that allowed him to be that, right?\nNow lets take people who have issues with me as Kanye West. They classify my motivational speeches as rants - like \"Why is he saying that? Why is he doing that?\" Well Ive reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting. And Ive got to a point that Michael Jackson did not break down. I have reached the glass ceiling - as a creative person, as a celebrity.\nWhen I say that it means I want to do product. I am a product person. Not just clothing but water bottle design, architecture, everything that you could think about. And Ive been at it for 10 years, and I look around and I say, \"Hey wait a second - theres no one around here in this space that looks like me.\" And if they are, theyre quiet as fuck!\nSo that means - wait a second - now were seriously in a Civil Rights movement. Like people used to joke about - remember our South Park photo - remember how funny that was? Do you think there would be a Givenchy in the hood if it wasnt for that South Park photo. But no one thinks about that - no one thinks about the names I got called for wearing tight jeans.\nZL: You reference that in the record, you talk about that. \"No ones liked him since hes been wearing tight jeans.\" Everybody knows you brought back real rap. I mean you reference that in the record.\nKW: Im saying yall had all that, but I brought real rap back. Im going to do dope things. And I wanna take this opportunity to speak to something, because I go to Hypebeast sometimes to look at the new things thatre coming out. And every time my name goes up, theres a series of people who write just negative comments - they wanna joke around and say, \"Why is he still trying? Why is he doing this?\" They like diss me as a person for trying. Now mind you, Ive brought 10 years of product that has added to humanity.\nAnd now, what they dont realize when I say \"Hey this is Pusha T, this is what it is\" I have to remind Pusha T that hes Pusha T. Because the radio, if theyre not playing a song of his that has an R&B hook on it or works at a certain level of trap tempo and plays in clubs, its like we forget about that Clipse album that meant everything.\nAnd the reason why I relate it to design and what we do in design is saying thats the music that us as creatives that wanted to get into design - we looked at Clipse as the gods, and this is our soundtrack to creativity. And its not a trap beat that comes in on that soundtrack to creativity. No knock to trap, cause I did \"Cant Tell Me Nothing\" - I like it. But its been commercialized to the point where - and Im not mentioning no names - but people used to use the term \"R&B nigga\" but then it was \"rappers.\" But then rappers didnt wanna be no R&B nigga. Now the rappers is the new R&B niggas! The rappers the new radio! Like wheres the culture at? Where is the culture at?\nSo then I scream - and Im sitting in the middle of it - whether Im at a dinner with Anna Wintour, or Im at a listening session with Pusha, or me and Virgil are in Rome giving designs to Fendi over and over and gettin our designs knocked down. Brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no. How many motherfuckers you done seen with a leather jogging pant? Meaning when I see Hedi Slimane and its all like, \"OK this is my take on the world\" - yeah he got some nice $5,000 jeans in there, some nice ones here and there, some good shit here and there.\nBut we culture. Rap the new rock n roll! We culture! Rap is the new rock n roll! We the rock stars!\nZL: Its been like that now for a minute.\nKW: Its been like that for a minute, Hedi Slimane! Its been like that for a minute. We the real rock stars, and Im the biggest of all of em. Im the number one rock star on the planet.\nCLICK HERE FOR PART",

"I’ll take one question. I wanted to vibe off an idea, and then I can riff off of that…they said I’ve got 20 minutes or so, I might go longer\nOK, everyone please be completely quiet, because I can literally hear a whisper, and it’ll throw off my stream of consciousness, and when I get my stream of consciousness going that’s when I give the best, illest quotes. Literally, a whisper can throw it off\nToday was the first time I realised, If I could have done it again I would have gone to the Art Institute over the American Academy of Art, I would have researched where I could have got the best and the strongest education\nAnd I’m sure this will end up online, so I don’t want to diss anyone at the American Academy, I’m sure it’s equal to the Art Institute of Chicago by now, but at the time I was going I would look around at the work of the class and not feel inspired by the teachers, and I kinda, the idea of being a fine artist, that’s a really difficult profession to get into, to be respected in, to make money at. Maybe the goal for some of the people was just to work at an advertising agency or at a record label\nMy goal, if I was going to do art, fine art, would have been to become Picasso or greater\nThat always sounds so funny to people, comparing yourself to someone in the past that has done so much, and in your life you’re not even allowed to think that you can do as much. That’s a mentality that suppresses humanity\nSome of you here probably remember the night when the Donda tweets came through me and I started talking about professions that you guys are going into, that seemed they had nothing to do with a rapper. I was talking about a band of thinkers that could remove religion, race, gender, and somehow come together to find solutions for a broken planet\nWe have the resources as a civilization to find a utopia, but we’re led by the most greedy and the least noble\nWhat I notice about creatives is that, and one of the reasons why I get into trouble, is, not only do I want to design video games, or make music, or ride bikes, I think one of the most important things to my ability to create so much in the past 30 years is my desire to play sports. I approach creativity like a sport, where if I have a drawing I react just like a jock: LOOK AT THE FUCKING DRAWING RIGHT THERE YEAH!\nWe’re all creatives here, we’re all born artists. Some people are artists of business, some people are artists of composition\nWe were taught to hide our black fingernail polish and put our head down in the back of the class and not notice out of fear that someone might laugh at one of our ideas – that our idea could become a mockery or a failure in some way\nThere’s a Bible saying, ‘No weapon formed against me shall prosper’. Recently I’ve been doing interviews and I’ve had to go back to this verse because I don’t think there’s a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I also don’t think there’s one more prosperous. So what weapons have prospered? The smoke and mirrors of other opinions\nI was sitting with Steve McQueen, he shot the visuals for All Day two days ago, it’s completely different to the Brit awards\nSo it doesn’t get taken out of context, I’m going to use the word ‘like’. I’m not saying it is, I’m using it as a comparison. So people that want to say ‘Kanye goes to Oxford and tells everyone blah blah blah’. And I’m not telling you this. I’m telling you what I told Steve McQueen in private\nWhat I said was The Matrix is like the Bible of the post-information age\nI compared it like, when the hundred guys come at Neo, those are opinions, that’s perception, that’s tradition. Attacking people from every which angle possible. If you have a focus wide and master senses like Laurence Fishburne and you have a squad behind you, you literally can put the world in slow motion\nIt’s still February, right? \nBy the way, I don’t know the days of the week. I just go to exactly when my appointment is\nWe’d just look at each other and say, it’s still February. For the sheer mount of work that we were able to put into the world. Some of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming. But nonetheless they came back to back to back to back. Answering every crazy interview question, blocking every shot, catching every rebound. Aside from the right I don’t have to give my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been batting 2000. I know that’s incorrect also\nThis humanity that I talk about, this civilization that I talk about, this future utopia I talk about…it can only happen through collaboration\nI love Steve Jobs, he’s my favorite person, but there’s one thing that disappoints me. When Steve passed he didn’t give the ideas up. That’s kinda selfish. You know that Elon’s like ‘yeah, take these ideas’. Maybe there are companies outside of Apple that could work on them and push humanity forward. Maybe the stock brokers won’t like that, the stock holders wouldn’t like that idea, but ideas are free and you can’t be selfish with them\nI think that progression of mind with the advent of a human being named Drake you know, this idea of holding onto a number 1 spot. And then you get this guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any band ever. Be it me, or Paul McCartney \nI understand that I’m a servant. And with my voice, with my ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to amazing people. Call Elon Musk out of the blue, or call Obama out of the blue…he calls the home phone, by the way\nWith that, I have a responsibility to serve. Why do I say the Matrix is like the Bible? What is my definition of the Matrix? \nI work with an artist called Vanessa Beecroft, and she bought my daughter some toys\nI’d see toys that some people would buy for my daughter and I’d say this toy isn’t quality. I don’t want my daughter playing with this. There’s not enough love put into this, this is just manufactured with the will to sell, and not the will of inspiration\nVanessa is very focused, she’s like my eyes, she’s a piece of my brain. She bought my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole collection, that it’d play with the song Wolves, and based on this concept. And when my daughter saw these wolves, I’ve never seen her so happy. She was going so crazy, she was grabbing one, she was riding on top of one…I’ve never seen her happier than this moment. That level of happiness seems to be the thing that we’re fighting for every day, that we’re trying to buy back, trying to work for, especially in America\nIn America people really do wear $3000 shirts. For real. Here and in Stockholm people will be like ‘oh dude, it’s a $3000 shirt’\nI’m assuming I’m probably wearing a $2000 shirt but I got it for free from the designer so\nWe’ve been sold a concept of joy through advertising, through car advertising, through fashion branding. It’s not the concept of time, time with your family, time with your friends, the little time that we do have on earth and what we do with that. It was somehow sold to us through a Gucci bag or something\nTime is the only luxury. It’s the only thing you can’t get back. If you lose your luggage – I’m not gonna say the obvious brand of luggage that I’d normally say because I’ve got a meeting with them soon – if you lose your expensive luggage at the airport, you can get that back. You can’t get the time back\nIt feels like people do everything in life to get this BMW, this Benz, to get this townhome, to get 2.5 kids exactly. One of them has to be small, y’know!\nAnd you’re looking for this moment where you sit in your BMW after all the work you’ve done and all the accolades you get, and you somehow think you’re gonna get that level of joy that my daughter had when she received those wolves. And when you’re sitting in traffic in your BMW, it’s something that feels empty. To everyone who reaches that point. This concept of the selfish human, this idea of separation by race, or gender, or religion, or age, or my favourite thing to hate, class\nPeople say it takes a village to raise a child. People ask me how my daughter is doing. She’s only doing good if your daughter’s doing good. We’re all one family\nWe have the ability to approach our race like ants, or we have the ability to approach our race like crabs\nThis is a generation that is far less racist – yes, small remnants remain of even thinking of calling something of a racial slur\nWhite people that listen to rap say ‘nigger’…in the privacy of their own home\nThat idea , has passed. We’ve had The Cosby Show, Obama’s president, Beyonce’s great…that’s passed. But there’s still something you’re taught every day, especially in the UK, and that’s division by class. Our main focus, in my opinion…Imagine a world with no war, and imagine if everyone’s main focus, more so than going out to a club, their main focus was to help someone else\nI was joking with an interviewer earlier today…people talk about the number of viewers the Brits get, or the number of viewers the Grammys get. They need to do award shows for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I guess that doesn’t sell as many MasterCard commercials. Oh, I mentioned a brand! …I had two things…I was trying to get a flawless victory on my speech! No offence to MasterCard…but that was a big fucking logo in the middle!\nYou guys have been taught, without you knowing, ways to separate yourselves from each other. If you’re separated, you can be easily controlled. If you’re too busy pointing fingers at each other, rather than holding hands, you can’t get anything done\nYou know, Chris Rock called my album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy…well, Chris Rock and everyone else at every single media publication called My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy the best album of the last 25 years. This only came through collaboration\nOne of the most memorable things about MBDTF was Nicki Minaj, and the fact that she kicked my ass, on my own song, on one of the best albums…the best album – I’m just saying what the critics said – of the last 25 years. The best album of the past 25 years that I spent a year and a half making, out there. I was exiled from my country, it was a personal exile, but exile. To come back and deliver my magnum opus of a work, and to be outshined…to be beat by a girl, basically\nThis was necessary. I think it was one of the most important points of working on that album, was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is. Just think of a comparison, if you think about why did it take so long for the new Yeezys to come out? Why did I have to leave one group and go to another group? Why did that group not want to speak to me? I think the Yeezys I was doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse. Because these guys were like ‘we’re worrying about this shoe, we’re gonna put it on this celebrity’. And the head’s son would come and say ‘my favourite shoe is the Yeezy’. And it’s like ‘ahhh, I can’t hear about these YEEZYS anymore!’. Like everyone talking about Nicki’s verse, ‘I can’t hear about this verse anymore!’. It was gonna work for her anyway, but let’s just say that in some way in helped give her exposure. She was able to go on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide. And it was not locked because of my career\nOne of my biggest Achilles heels has been my ego. And if I, Kanye West, the very person, can remove my ego, I think there’s hope for everyone\nWhen I talk about collaboration and the creative process, the best idea wins\nI’m proud of the consistency of the performances I’ve done since I’ve been out here. And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out and being forced to work together. The best lighting guy on the planet, the best staging guy, the best video guy, another staging guy, a guy with a laptop for no reason…To be able to deliver, back to back to back, extremely successful, inspiring, groundbreaking, visual, visceral, creative moments that otherwise would have been challenged. And the kid from Chicago screaming from the top of the stage for 40 minutes in a row. I’ve had to pull that card out a few times. Not particularly screaming, but remember, I will scream\nMy momma taught me that if I was in a grocery store and I’m by myself and a stranger grabbed my hand, scream at the top of your fucking lungs. If I’m at an awards show and a stranger grabs my hand and they say so we’re going to use these moving lights, or we’re gonna play the music right now before we define the look, or we’re gonna cut the TV cameras in a traditional way. I’ll scream at the top of my fucking lungs\nPeople say I have a bad reputation. I think I’ve got the best reputation in the building. They want you to have a reputation of tucking your black nail polish into your pockets and sitting in the corner of the class, and not fighting for your ideas out of fear of being ridiculed\nThat’s one of my favourite ones…to be called crazy\nI remember when I was young and saw my dad working on computers. And the guy he was working with ended up being a bad guy. And the guys that helped him, that he had the voice to find, didn’t have the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to his vision, to his dream, for it to be considered to be a success. But the success is that his successor will be successful in his lifetime. You could say \"But you are successful?\" i’m successful in learning about the beauty that is afforded to rich people. But in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it’s something that is beating out of my chest. ‘Wait a second, I was middle class, and I didn’t get to see none of this shit!’\nLet’s have an NBC telethon moment, and say that beauty has been stolen from the people and is being sold back to them under the concept of luxury!\nIt’s illegal to not wear clothes, and also possibly too cold. That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to do! Clothing should be like food. There should never be a $5000 sweater. You know what should cost $5000? A car should be $5000. And you know who should work on the car? The people that work on the $500,000 cars. All the best talent in the world needs to work for the people. And I am so fucking serious about this concept that I will stand in front of anyone and fight for it. Because I was 14 and middle class. I know what it felt like to not get what I have\nPeople say to me ‘you’re successful, what are you crying about?’. I’m crying about the people. I’m crying about their daughters. Our daughters, as one family. What good is it? What good is anything that everyone can’t have? Every ism. They think we’re done with racism. What about elitism, what about separatism, what about classism? That’s all",

"Mouloud Achour: I always wondered, when we were talking with Jean, he was saying that it was hard for you to get into this \"fashion world\", and you were saying it was hard for Michael Jackson to put his videos on MTV. And I dont realise, how much a guy like you, that I listen to everyday, I watch everyday, and influences the use - everytime you do something, people wanna do it. So how is it possible that the big houses dont understand that?\nKanye: The thought was that everything popular was very basic and not complex and the negative connotation of commercial. So soon as youre commercial, you dont have the complexity of a Bach, a Mozart, a Basquiat, and if you say out loud as a commercial person that youre in the same breath as Basquiat, then everyone looks at you like youre an egomaniac or something. But then youll be like, wait a second, you know I was a gifted artist since age 5, and like in national competitions and went to art school. Im actually getting an honorary doctorate on May 5th from the Art Institute of Chicago so, it was a great wall to break down\nBut also, whats fun about playing in the pop field versus the art field is you get a lot of exposure and the majority of the pop artists dont have the same responsibility to the sensibility so its easy to slam dunk them. To hit that BRIT Awards performance super hard against everything else thats going on. And, but I want all the best for all of the pop stars. I want all of us to have as inspiring of performances as possible. I think its important, you know, our point of references, we need to study Fellini and Jodorowsky, Corbusier, and the different information that Ive got from living out here with Paris, hanging out with Jean, and going to the French flea market and everything, that constant information, education, education is the power",

"I appreciate everyone’s support for my clothing line but I wanted to clarify a few things… The name of the line is Kanye West not DW… The DW was a design element placed on the invite in homage to my mom :-). I really appreciate the fake DW twitter page but since it’s not official I can’t co-sign any information on it\n“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” – Leonardo Da Vinci\nMore clarity… I have no agency representing me currently… William Morris was fired after Cara Lewis quit. I love Cara Lewis :-)\nI love being back at my fashion office learning and creating. It’s so challenging and fun and I’m surrounded by amazing people. They say you only live once but every time I come to work I feel like I’m starting a second life. You guys might think I have some type of backing for my line but I don’t. I did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money I made touring to follow my passion. I’ve been working at this for 8 years now. From the first offers to do urban clothing lines that I turned down…to begging Bape to do my line and never making any real headway…to having an office in LA that was shut down after the “MTV” moment along with my tour with Gaga\nI moved to Japan for one month after that and designed every night in my room. I had this opportunity to intern at Fendi and was also offered a position at Versace which I could not take due to my contract with LV which was for 2 years. I moved to Rome after I left Japan and worked at Fendi for 4 months undercover. I was there to give ideas for the men’s collection. I snuck to Giuseppe Zanotti’s factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in Paris. After doing the first LV collection I was sure I would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity\nI designed a sneaker called the Yeezy with Nike. I’m “allowed” to design 1 pair of sneakers every 2 years. I have more ideas…\nEarly 2011 I moved to Paris and opened a small design studio. The language barrier was quite difficult. I still don’t have a Paris VAT number to this day. I don’t know what a VAT is but every time I asked why we didn’t have fabrics they said it was because of the VAT. In Paris I met many great people in design including the master Azzedine Alaia. Azzedine even came by my studio one day :-). This was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small Paris studio in a courtyard opposite Collate\nI remember being 5 years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots. She said I would always point to the most expensive furs, even as a child. LOL. There is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point. For the first 16 or 17 years of my life the only thing I knew about women’s clothing was what my Mom would wear. I guess some critics would joke that I still don’t know anything. LOL. My Mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished “Cosby Show” sweater :-) to pick me up from school. The teachers said I couldn’t focus. I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing Nike’s in 4th grade\nBeing a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively. I was just discussing becoming the creative director for the Jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out, “you should do a Jetsons tour!”\nThis just happened a few hours ago. I was very insulted of course because for anyone that’s seen the Watch the Throne Tour, Coachella, Glow in the Dark or Runaway know that I have real ideas\nI appreciate having the most nominations at the Grammy’s but I feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical. Good logic tells me “smile Kanye”, the world likes you again. “Red or blue pill?”…aaaaand Swallow. LOL. I wouldn’t have the prestige I have if it wasn’t partially for the Grammys validation and I honor that\nHmmmmm, what to wear? Here I go again… Yeezy the trend setter or complete f*cking fashion victim…the verdict is still out. This is just a train of thought but I figure it’s better to read than trained thoughts\nWhat good is fame and prestige if you can’t use it to help people? I want to help by doing what I know how to do best…create\nI have started a new company and I’m so excited about the name…it’s got the best name ever…of all companies…of all time!!!\nThe name of the company is DONDA\nDONDA is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas. I used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out. Dr Dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product. I am assembling a team of architects, graphic designers, directors musicians, producers, A&Rs, writers, publicist, social media experts, app guys, managers, car designers, clothing designers, DJs, video game designers, publishers, tech guys, lawyers, bankers, nutritionists, doctors, scientists and teachers\nDONDA will be comprised of over 22 divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford. I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me. We want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear, touch, taste and feel. To dream of, create, advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need.. To marry our wants and needs…DONDA\nThis will all take time but I wanted everyone’s to know what I really care about…I care about people…I care about my fans…I care about people who have never heard of me…There are over 7 billion people on the planet now…It’s something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic. Music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy. Sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right :-). My mom was an English teacher so I know she sends an SMDH from heaven :-). 5:18 am in London, my dreams keep me woke\nThe Watch the Throne tour was a small example of what a DONDA experience can be…\nI’m currently working on a new 7 screen experience…\nThis is one of our projects to be released this year called 2016 Olympics…It’s semi sci-fi, since 2016 is only 4 years away, :-)\nWe would also like to design the MTV awards. We’re taking everything 10 steps at a time, LOL! I wanted to put this in the world, in hopes that the people who can actually make a difference will stand up and reach out. We need as many amazing powerful smart talented wealthy people to be involved. Come get on board…don’t just sit there…reach out\nWe can collectively effect the world through design. We need to pick up where Steve Jobs left off\nWhen I said wealthy I wanted to point out there are so many billionaires in the world that can come together and help to redesign it and help education. School systems were designed to turn people into factory workers. Schools should be designed to prep human beings for real life\nSpike Jonze and I want to do a Summer school that tries new forms of curriculum. Math classes should teach addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, accounting and money management aaaaaand cut!!!\nUNLESS YOU’RE A MATH MAJOR!!! Kids you should be able to take majors starting in grammar school like how it is at performing art schools. Instead of kicking kids out of schools for using their iPhones…why not promote it?\nAllow kids to use search engines to do test…like the real WORLD!!! Give kids the amount of test they would have in a year in one day but they have to get everything perfect…please excuse my grammar…I know it’s extremely ironic\nSome kids have better memories than others…what about emotional IQ’s? What about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are?\nExcuse me…I just get excited at the possibilities…the more excited I get the more grammatical errors you’ll see…\nWe need to take what Michael Jackson felt and Mcqueen and Steve Jobs, and we need make things better\nWhen me and Jay toured, every night I peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us\nThe adrenaline is running…I don’t know if I can even get to sleep now. From Wall Street to the London riots to Chicago murders…I sit everyday and ask what can I do to make a difference. I know this is not a very rapper thing to say but I haven’t bought a new car or piece of jewelry in about 2 years\nI invest every dime back into creativity, hiring amazing creatives, paying for flights, offices…etc. My area of expertise is in music, my passion is in music, design, film and products…my strength is connectivity…\nThere are so many broken systems from the economy to school systems to jail systems…we need experts for this. We need scientist and top world designers to directly affect governments\nI just wanted to share what’s been on my mind…\n“If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple…but if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” – George Bernard Shaw",

Kanye West\nKanye West: Wassup\nEnvy: I didnt think it was gonna happen, I said I bet Kanyes not gonna come back up here I thought it was a wrap\nKW: Im coming back every time\nCTG: Let me start with some positivity, man. I think \"Only One\" and \"Wolves\" is dope records\nKW: Oh wow thank you!\nCTG: I think theyre really dope tunes\nKW: Yeah\nAngela Yee: This is starting way different than the last one!\nKW: But! But! I dont like \"FourFiveSeconds\"! And why did you do that at the Grammys? \nCTG: I do like \"FourFiveSeconds\" though\nAY: He loved that song\nCTG: I dont like the auto-tune when you sing but I like \"FourFiveSeconds\"\nKW: I dont like auto tune either but I need it\nCTG: Really? Why? I hear people say that, why?\nKW: Cause, I could do, I can like bend my voice in other ways, like at the end of Runaway and everything? I like to do that\nCTG: I got you. And thank you for inviting me to the fashion show as well\nKW: Yeah\nCTG: I didnt feel like I belonged there\nAY: We thought it was a set up, hes gonna walk in \nEnvy: We definitely thought it was a set up, we said hes gonna get beat up in there, hes gonna get jumped\nCTG: I felt like it was only right. You came here, you know what Im saying? Through all the slander, why wouldnt I come to the fashion show?\nKW: Yeah\nEnvy: You put him next to Drake which was kind of awkward\nCTG: They didnt put me next to Drake. I went to stand in the back and Drake happened to be back there\nAY: Charlamagne was standing by Drake the whole time\nEnvy: Now lets talk about your shoes that just been released, Yeezy Boosts\nKW: Yeah I heard yall dont like those\nAY: No not yall, I said that I actually have a pair of shoes that look like them and I like them\nCTG: Thats not a good thing when a girl has shoes that look like mens shoes\nAY: Why?\nCTG: I like the black colour. The grey colour when I first saw them looked like a paper mache project. But the black ones look tough\nKW: Yeah we coming with the black ones real soon\nAY: But that is a big accomplishment for you, you put that out, limited run at first, and they sold out and now people are buying them online for over $1500\nEnvy: 1500 for them\nKW: yeah see I dont want them to be limited, thats something that the company did. I wanted as many people to get them as possible. And I dont want the price to be $350, I dont want to play this sneaker culture game and all this where they be reselling them for higher prices and stuff, I just want people to have what I make. Theres no limited release to the College Dropout, or a limited release of Graduation. You know and I think in clothing right now theres a real separatism, theres $5000 sweat shirts everybody spending that money trying to show up in the club, and act like they.. You know what Im saying? We need to spend that money on our families. My point, and what Im doing in clothing right now is Im going and taking the talent. I came from the Ralph show and I was talking to Ralph like man, I need your help, cause you know how to make clothes and I think I know what my generation wants. But its very difficult if you dont have that production and that experience that Ralph has. and its really difficult to get those price points, you know the Zara and H&M price points if you dont got the factories, if you dont got the boats. You know I talked about this before\nCTG: So why is it $350? Cause its hard to..\nKW: I have no idea they just priced it that. I think they just, I think their logic was they didnt want it to go from um, the other company and go to Adidas and be like man, why they drop the price? Cause sometimes the public wont always understand the transition. Like Steve Jobs always had the iPad in his head, but he couldnt do it coming from a keyboard and a floppy disk to the iPad, he has to walk people in to this\nEnvy: I thought the whole idea of you going to Adidas was you would have more control, and it was your ish, and you could do everything\nCTG: Over price points\nKW: Yeah I do have a lot more, at least I could do something! But any relationship that starts off you aint gonna have all the control. You know what Im saying? Its a marriage. Usually the first year of any situation is the toughest, and then when you guys start to communicate, you know it cane be powerful\nEnvy: Now explain this to me. Im a sneakerhead, I have tonnes of sneakers. I assumed it to be like, I dont like to compare, but the other sneakers you did, like leather, they were more of a sneaker sneaker, like you could ball out in your others sneakers, this one I dont think I could play basketball in\nKW: You actually could play basketball in this one better. Because first of all its got boosts which is the best technology and Im not just saying that contractually with Adidias, Im saying that from someone that goes to the gym, and if Im wearing that like my Boosts actually I feel better cause I have problems with the back of my achilles from performing so much\nCTG: I did say fat girls with cankles, it look like theyll be comfortable for them\nKW: Yeah! I mean people joke that they look sorta like the Uggs, right? But whats really bugged out is Im actually working on trying to make a sexier Ugg. Cause you see Uggs all the time\nEnvy: They are comfortable\nKW: And I see, you know, I see stuff for the future. Im always, Im such a futurist that I have to slow down and talk in the present. This was a proposition to where I think shoes will go. I think the colour palates, with the red over here and the thirty different colours, the Black History Month version and all that, I think thats gonna be out of there in the future. This is for me, as humbly I would say I am the most influential person in footwear right now\nCTG: Theres no way to humbly say that\nKW: Well truthfully, I am the most influential person in footwear. \nEnvy: Those are re-releases but when it comes to new sneakers I think he is\nAY: How hard is it to get that balance between wanting to get something people can afford, but then also wanting to use those materials and make things really special, you know things that make them more for you\nKW: Yeah those materials is all a game that the factories play too. Silk is in style, silk is more expensive from the factories. You can get everything for a better price, its all in how you negotiate with the factories. And my end goal, ten years from now will be to have everything at a Zara level, like I think when Steve made it with phones, it wasnt a show of class anymore. You know you had the Vertu phone, the $4000 phone you felt like you was better than somebody\nCTG: I dont understand this talk at all \nKW: The phone, Im talking about the vertu phone\nCTG: Oh phones!\nKW: Yeah Im not clear a speaker, you know I had this car accident and everything and I just and ever since then Ive been a mumble mouth. But what Im saying is, people are trying to put on a jacket to try and act like they are better than you. I think this idea of being better than the next man is the wrong mentality in the first place. We were born in to a broken world that has been separated by race, religion and class\nCTG: But you confuse me when you say stuff like that cause you do act like you are better than people\nKW: No\nCTG: Like the Grammys is a great example, when you run up there and tell everyone respect the artistry, but its like youre not respecting the artistry\nKW: Yeah that. And I deserved it that was completely hypocritical. Im go ahead and tell yall like the other day. I went to dinner and I sat down with Taylor Swift, right, and ironically they were playing the Beck album\nAY: Ironically or you think they did that on purpose?\nKW: No they did it on purpose so I could finally hear it and I was like man\nCTG: So you hadnt even heard it when you did the Grammy rant?\nKW: I was like man, this is like kinda good, I aint gonna lie\nCTG: So you hadnt even heard the Beck album when you did the rant?\nKW: Nah! I hadnt even heard it man, I just\nAY: Charlamagne you do that all the time, you say somebody is wack without hearing the album\nCTG: But I admit it! When did I do that? Thats not true. I cant even say if Beck didnt deserve it cause I didnt hear it\nAY: And that was an argument we had cause I was like Kanye might not know, a lot of people hadnt even heard Beck, Id never heard it, so. People were saying no Im sure he heard it, he had to have heard it to say that\nKW: You know what? I bet you the album is really good. Im gonna listen to the album and maybe it was potentially an album of the year but the Grammys still have a commercial component to it. They wanna sell commercials, so they have these big superstars sitting in the audience and theyre advertising theyre performing coming up next thats what they try to do to get those views. You dont have these people sitting here and you know, have them and their hearts beating and stuff like we work too hard for all that, to be losing in a situation where, cause I mean whos winning? We dont get none of that advertising money. Yall dont play with us. Thats what my main point it\nCTG: Why you think superstars go where theyre tolerated, like yourself you go where youre tolerated but not celebrated. You dont come to the Soul Train awards, or the BET Hip Hop awards, youll hear Kanye won but Kanye is not here to accept this award\nKW: Thats why we need to support the people that support us, and not just particularly a black thing. We always say this is a black show, you know its gonna be a while. I aint got the answers on how to change the voting system, I aint got the answers on how to make it everyone is honoured in the proper way, and sometimes maybe theres two people that should win. Whos to say who should win? But I think itd be a class thing to. You know it carries more weight if you win a Grammy than if you win a BET award, so we still go\nCTG: Says who though?\nKW: Says society. And this is what this is about, this is why I respect this show because this is the voice of society, this is Id say the voice of the barber shop, this the voice of the streets, and you know the Grammys are, its a statement of classicism. Like if you go to my house Imma hit the stunt button for a second. You see my 21 Grammys laid out that my wife forced me to take out of the bathroom and put in one place\nCTG: Thats why its interesting to hear you get at the Grammys cause you could be selfish and say well Ive got 21, whatever\nKW: Yeah I mean I think I deserve more\nKW: You know it’s all, like I said we was born into a world that’s separated by class, race, and religion. So class is one of the things people want, you want to be first class, but in a plane crash everybody dead. It ain’t no class then, it’s just a whole crash. Some of the things, when I first came out with the idea of DONDA and I was tweeting out all these idea; airplane design, this design, this design. You know you see of course like me and Kim, we can take private but we really wanna be in the airport, we wanna be next to the people. I get inspiration when I see what people are wearing, I get inspiration when I see what people are going through. I see people walking a line slower or getting patted down, you know I gotta tell you this one good story about class. I was going to London where I’m going tonight, and I was in the first class line and it was real crowded. And I looked at the coach line for customs and it was completely empty. We went over to the coach line and got through right away. And everybody that’s sitting there with their Hermes belts and their big hats, they didn’t want to lower they class in order to get through faster when time is the only luxury. It’s a lot of stuff that I’ve been learning over the past couple of years and I’ve used my money and my position and my relationships to learn about class and I think my approach is I think more, Robin Hood now\nCTG: Its more ghetto. Even though you’re getting up in class its still rachet\nKW: Yeah I guess. I mean ghetto is fun. I’m from Chicago, my wife got a big ass, we stay ghetto\nEnvy: Did you reach out to Beck after though? Did you reach out to Beck after you heard his album like maybe I slipped up a little bit, maybe I went too far?\nKW: Yes I got his number and I was supposed to call but I keep forgetting\nAY: What? You did not forget, you just don’t know what to say\nCTG: Don’t feel bad because I thought Beck was a beer until you jumped on there\nAY: Beck was very humble about it though, he agreed. He was like ‘Yeah I mean, Beyonce should’ve won’ it wasn’t like he disagreed with you. But I felt bad for him\nKW: No I felt good for him because think of all the good stuff that happen to me in the past 7 days, 8 days. The person that won the most is Beck. Because if I hadn’t done that then his album of the year would have never been mentioned. Now its in all the chatter; ‘Kanye West Messes Up Again’ ‘Kanye West Donkey of the Day’. You know I’m already the enemy so you can’t get no worse than the villain\nAY: It has to be hard to win an award and have all these different people saying you shouldn’t have won. And then you have the Beehive going in and leaving negative nasty comments and how terrible he is\nCTG: Well its all subjective though\nKW: Yeah it is all subjective but\nBut you know, he should win an award for what he did. You know, rock album or something like that. But he shouldn’t have won that award in my opinion. But who am I to have an opinon. Ya know?\nCTG: You’re Kanye West\nKW: Exactly\nCTG: If you don’t respect it then it’s not to be respected. But one thing we always ask in the barbershops is why is Kanye always caping for Beyonce? I love Beyonce, I’m a Pinkett-Smith-Winfrey-Knowles-Carter, but it seems like you’re always coming to her aid. And nobody, Beyonce don’t need no caping she’s Beyonce\nKW: I know it’s really ironic that it’s always Beyonce for some reason. Why is It Beyonce? Why don’t I go off on whoever going off on my wife on twitter? I think Beyonce is a great representation of an artist working hard and trying their best and getting the results from it. So say Beyonce’s previous album wasn’t as well received as this new album, and she got low like how I got low on my new album, and delivered something that everybody loved. In America we have to respect greatness when we see it and we can’t smack it in the face at the cost of some votes splitting, at the cost of blowing someone who can sell some t-shirts. If you see something that’s great, you got to respect it. I remember I was trying to get on the basketball team in 8th grade, I hit every free throw, hit every layup, and I looked on the list and I wasn’t on the list. And the coach just gave me the Kanye shrug\nKW: You know that’s like the best thing cause you get to leave school...\nAY: Get all the chicks\nKW: Yeah. We had a small gym, where like you’d run into a broadway stage like if you hit a layup and stuff\nCTG: So hurt people hurt people. He probably said ‘Kanye I’mma let you finish but you’re not going to make this basketball team\nKW: Now my point is, you not gonna have somebody hit all the shots and you not give them that credit. And I think a lot of times its exactly what you say, Beyonce don’t need no help. People look at Beyonce cause shes rich, respect to Hov she’s a beautiful woman, she’s talented. And so they figure she’s got everything and so you don’t even need nothing else. But I think she deserves the proper accolades because she’s an inspiration\nCTG: She got 20 Grammys! 21..20?\nAY: Not album of the year\nCM: I thought she did win that one went there for album of the year\nKW: I don’t think she’s ever one an album of the year Grammy. And this is funny because Taylor was talking to me about this. She was saying that when she was the victim she won every award and now that shes powerful and the biggest selling artist, now shes not winning awards anymore, cause theyre like \"what do you need?\" Its once again, its that moment where the rich people, our line is getting clogged up because its a practical joke that everybody in the airport is playing on the rich people, as they should, because as rich people, our focus shouldnt be on how we get a new Phantom, how we get a bigger house. Our focus should be on how do we help the middle to the lower class to have a better life. And I think that we get distracted with luxury, so-called luxury goods, so-called luxury cars, like... And I embrace this, any time a rich person gets the piss taken out of them its cool, dont do it to me all the time and stuff but...\nCTG: But you know thats always what we felt about you because you used to speak up like when you said George Bush dont care about black people, you were speaking up for the have-nots. But now it seems like you were just fighting for the civil rights of rich people lately. \nKW: I think its the rights of everyone. And another thing that I used to get really caught up on was with race. You know, with race its like, okay we know its racist people, we know that a lot of white men over the age of 60 are racist, we embrace that. We know that a lot of people that are in power dont really... theyre like Donald Sterling. We understand that. We know that, but the world is moving. 10 years from now, 20 years from now, every person of color or female or any minority that comes into power will eventually shift it. You got the ozone layer, you got all this stuff you see 100 years from now the entire world might be black. Just to even survive on the earth, period\nEnvy: Now you mentioned you stood up for Beyoncé, people asked, you stood up for Beyoncé, you stand up for her maybe more than you stand up for your own wife. Recently, people been going at your wife crazy, from the Paper magazine cover, they say, \"Why would she do that? She has money, is it just for fame? Is it just for Instagram? Is it just for attention? You know even Amber Rose came on the program a couple of days ago and said your wife was fake. How do you reply to all of these people and what do you say to everybody? Even with us, when we seen her on the cover it was kind of like, yo Kim is filthy, you know, she has a child, she has a family, why would she do that cover?\nKW: Which question... lets do the cover first. One of the things in breaking class is respected art can break class. So one of the things that shut up a lot of people is the fact that Jean-Paul Goude took the photograph, that used to shoot Grace Jones. And Grace Jones figure, physique was as new and different as Kims physique was. And our position of power, were not gonna accept the physique that was given to us. You know, that was told to us that was the proper way to look. My daughter has a chance of being shaped like my wife, so until she, between this age and til the age shes like that, Im gonna be fighting for that shape to be considered the highest of class. Or not the highest of class, at least equal to what someone looks at, like a skinny model for. My first introduction, one of my first introductions to beauty was the Helmut Newton book, this really big book, and every woman in there was naked. This is a straight photographer, he did Playboy and hell do St. Laurent ads and the highest level taste, and I was really drawn to the beauty of the way their photographs were set up and to the fact that I was attracted to the women also. I liked the two things at once. I like the physical attraction and I like the way the shot was set up. I think that with my wife, it had been a lot of times earlier in her career where she didnt have the access to that level of photographer, of course hes passed away now. So now that she has the access to a Jean-Paul Goude, a Steven Klein, a , I can name all the really high level, Jackie Nicholson, all the high level photographers, now, you know its important for her to stand, I think, for her to stand up in all of her glory and all her power. Now her power is in her body, is in her nudity. Her power is in her mind, her power is in her family, but body is one of the powers\nCTG: What happens when she gets older, though?\nKW: Well, shes got, she gon always have that body but shes gonna have mind, family, and shes gonna create a legacy\nCTG: You know, you name all those brands and stuff but the hood dont know that so the hood, the hood is like, \"Kanye, just tell your wife she dont gotta get naked no more.\"\nKW: But, she can get naked if she wants to, its not illegal to get naked and, you know, and then think about this, like if Adam had never ate the apple, wed all be naked. So...\nCTG: You hit us with that last time, I still have not understood that one in two years. Ive been tryna figure that one out for two years\nAY: But listen, do you feel compelled to reach out to Amber Rose, being that thats your ex-girlfriend and saying, \"Listen, calm it down, leave my wife alone and just chill out.\"?\nKW: Shes just soaking in the moment, nobody feel compelled to do nothing. If Kim had dated me when I first wanted to be with her, it wouldnt be an Amber Rose. You know what Im saying? Like... \nEnvy: So its your fault, Kim, its your fault. He hollad at you before\nCTG: But Amber said Kim was sending you naked pictures while yall was together though\nKW: I wish. I would have gladly, happily have liked to. Cause by the way its very hard for a woman to want to be with someone thats with Amber Rose so she wasnt sending nothing, you know what Im saying? Like I had to take thirty showers before I got with Kim, you know? Im sorry, please.. wait, dont ask me no more cause I just wanna be respectful, man\nCTG: Listen, I saw you say, I was watching something on TV and they said you were saying that fashion lines didnt want to deal with you cause you were married to a reality show star. Just on a business level, cause personally we can tell youre happy, just on a business level do you feel the Kardashian brand has hurt Kanye Wests brand?\nKW: No, its helped. Cause it just showed, like, my ability to bring Mos Def into the studio with Jay Z. My ability to bridge the gap. To bridge, you know, somebodys sitting over at this lunch table, theyre the fashion world, theyre all cool and stuff and somebodys sitting over at this lunch table, theyre a celebrity and they have a perception about that. And you know, I showed people the power of what happens when you work together. And now, you know, Kim can sell a dress faster than any magazine cover\nAY: And you got her on the cover of Vogue which is something we thought was never gonna happen, the way that Anna Wintour felt and how she had expressed that in the past\nEnvy: What did she say? She said something today or earlier today?\nAY: Oh about bringing North West to the fashion show. That was alleged though, they said allegedly she said thats not the proper place for a child. You know?\nKW: Yeah I cant speak on alleged comments\nCTG: Does it bother you when you see the news and theyre like, \"North West was crying at a fashion show\", I mean shes a baby, thats what babies do\nAY: And shes at her daddys fashion show, which makes sense, I mean I think you would want your daughter front row at your fashion show\nKW: Yeah, yeah, I mean think about it, no one can tell me where to have my child or not, you know?\nEnvy: I got four of them and they cry. You cant tell them when to cry or when not to cry, they gon cry\nCTG: Dame Dash at the BET Awards, BET Honors. Whyd you let him present you with that award?\nKW: Because he presented me to the world. You know, I wouldnt have a record deal if it wasnt for Dame Dash\nEnvy: How was that first conversation? Cause at one time he hated you, well Im not gonna say he hated you but he was very upset\nAY: I dont think he hated you, he just felt you werent loyal to him\nKW: And I wasnt, and this was an extremely visionary move on my part to move with, to roll with Jay Z\nEnvy: It was a smart move\nCTG: Did you tell Dame that? If hes the one that believed in you then why does Hov get the credit and the \"Big Brother\" records?\nKW: I mean, I mention Dame a lot in raps, but you know, the story is not done. You know, sometimes its been moments where like I was wildin out and Jay was like, \"Ye you got to sit this down right now, sit these couple plays out\" and you know, it was the moment when Roc-a-fella split. It made more sense for me career-wise to roll with Jay even though Dame had supported me. And I wonder, I say, where would we be, you know, if I had rolled with Dame? Would we have been, would I have been more successful? Would I have been less successful? I cant say, but at that time, you know, I came to Roc-a-fella because Jay Z was my idol. And it would have been very hard for me, you know, at that young state where I was to separate from my idol. You know, and thats the decision I made and then do I say there was some disloyalty or not? Yeah, I own up to that. Is it anything that me and Dame could do together now to make money? I think so. Will I do it?\nCTG: Hes got a film company, right?\nKW: Yeah were gonna work on films and actually I really like the films that hes doing. He had all types of ideas and Dame is like the original person who understood culture and really was in it in every situation and would go, you know, Beans had a problem, he would go pick Beans up. Hed have us on a jet with them, talking to us direct, talking to me and GLC directly. He was talking to me about GLC with the film company, like \"Yo we gotta put out GLCs album\", you know just kind of reminding me, similar to what you was saying last time we was talking about having the real niggas, you definitely got to say Dames a real nigga. So when he came over to the crib and I just saw him, I missed him, man I missed the good, I missed the bad, I missed all of that because all of that is what created College Dropout. That tension, all of that is what created Late Registration. And we creating something new now in the fashion world and in the film world\nEnvy: We realized the other day that you still have a love for music and the reason I say that is I dont know who we were talking to , we was talking to Tyga, we was talking to Ty Dolla $ign, and I heard a remix with so many different people, and its like Kanyes in the studio working with everybody\nCTG: Youve always got the new guys that may not even be next in the studio with you so you keep your ear to the streets\nKW: You know I just gotta, I have to work. You know I think a lot of times people get rich, people get comfortable, people fall in love and everything. You know, I went to this Drake concert in Germany. I flew to the concert to go see it. And he got this one line where he say like, something about people be falling in love with famous girls and dadada and they dont have be working as much. And he rapped it, and then when he rapped it he knew I was in the concert so he like looked down and stuff\nCTG: \"Too in love with fashion and women\" or something like that\nKW: Yeah something like that but you know, he was right. You know what Im saying? I gotta get on my job and thats why I got on the end of that \"Blessed.\" Hello, Im back! We back in the studio, its times that I gotta go pick my daughter up and take her to dance class in the morning and I try to create a regiment, but at least if I go to the studio like 6 hours a day. And its funny cause when I first sat with Tyga, like me and Virgil seen Tyga at the Balmain store and we knew he was fresh. You know, certain people, they have a certain talent with clothing: a Tyga, A$AP Rocky. Certain people got a certain talent with the bars and shit: Young Thug, Big Sean. You know, and I sat in the studio with, it was me, Thug, Sean, Travi$, Tyga, and I was just saying how we gotta bring our resources together. We have to see how we can help each other to make each other way fresher, share information, build, have cyphers like back in the Wu-Tang era, like people used to have cyphers. So last night when I working on \"All Day\" at Q-Tips house, it was like me, Vic Mensa, Q-Tip, and we was just building on culture, culture, culture and instead of trying to write bars, we built on that and then I started writing the bars. Then they started coming and we started bouncing ideas off each other so with me, Im only a humble servant. If you have power you have to empower. You have the power to give power away, what I said on the song, \"Power.\" \"No one man should have all that power\" is a true statement. No man has the power, the power is in the people. The people give you the power. The people chose me to be the peoples champ. Soon as I go up and talk about, \"I, I, me, me\" you lose that. And then you got next generations, you got, no matter how I hard I try, Drake is gonna speak to a generation in a way that I might not have been at that same basketball game he was at. That same high school game, watched that same TV show, went to that same club. Tygas gonna speak to a certain generation, Big Seans gonna speak to a certain generation, and its important for a revolution, like Common said on that song he just won for, its the youth and the OGs have to come together. You need the energy of the youth and the knowledge of the OGs\nCTG: Thats in the Bible, old men for council, young men for war\nKW: Thats why I sit with Puff, I sit with Dame, I sit with Jay, I sit with Farrakhan. I talk to the OGs and try to figure out how we can help each other\nCTG: Now with Tyga, mentioning Tyga, youre executive producing his album. Do you feel like his relationship with your sister-in-law is inappropriate?\nKW: I think that, thats a good question right there. I think he got in early, I think he was smart. \nCTG: I told him hes redshirting her, and I said thats a great redshirt prospect, and lets be clear, Russell was 35 when he met Kimora, she was 17. But Im from the south too so I dont know\nKW: Theyre closer in age than a lot of relationships that I know, you know?\nCTG: Hes 25, shell be 18 in August\nKW: Yeah I knew Tyga was smart\nCTG: Tyga came up here though and said they were just friends. I mean thats what hes supposed to say but...\nKW: Yeah I cant speak on that, I cant speak on nobodys relationship\nCTG: Thank you Ye, we appreciate that a whole lot, Ye\nEnvy: Your album, what kind of album are we getting? What should we expect?\nKW: Bars. Songs. You know, cook out music that just feels good, you know, like my last album was a protest to music. I was like, \"Ima take my ball and go home.\" If yall aint gonna let me play the way I wanna play or do clothes or do this, start shootin the ball real slow, might be at the free throw for a long time just... That was my whole album. The album dont even got no music. I just let yall have a little music on there on \"Bound\" but that was it. But this albums just embracing the music, embracing joy, and being of service to the people. I just hope that people like it and enjoy it, you know? Thats it\nCTG: You mentioned Minister Farrakhan, I also saw you say when you was backstage at the Grammys you said you didnt want to speak to much cause you didnt want to jeopardize your clothing line, but a lot of people dont like to stand next to the Minister cause they feel like he jeopardizes their business. Why are you not afraid to show your relation with the Minister?\nKW: You know, its interesting cause I actually asked for the Minister to give me my BET Visionary award and he felt like it wasnt the right time, and maybe for reasons just like that. Right now Im working on a documentary with him about him and about his music. Hes a classically trained violinist. And hes also one of the most humane people and now hes got that stamp in the same way how my wife was stamped with the sextape, the Minister was stamped with yeah. And its important that while hes still alive he has to see the people appreciate his message, cause you ever hear him talk, its about humanity. Its about one race. Soon as you hear his name, I see peoples faces change, they have a perception. Its a lot that I can learn from him, perhaps the Minister mentioned Beck won too many times, or something like that and its things I can learn in my path of how to always keep my communication as open as possible cause right now its right at that tip where its like... yeah we gotta have him cause hes gonna bring some excitement to the Grammys and all that. But were working on this documentary and its amazing, it shows that he had a white violin instructor, but then he talked about because he was black he couldnt get the white instructor and there was no black instructors that could instruct him well enough. And he talks about how he was asked to stop doing music, he had to choose between the Nation and music and then how the honorable Elijah Muhammad asked him to come in one day to play the violin and he embraced his passion of music and its a beautiful story about a beautiful soul thats very misunderstood and one of almost powerful messengers and its very important that we protect our messengers, very important that we support them\nCTG: Yeah the Ministers very sharp. You think its kind of confusing when hell say negative things about Jewish people but then say we should learn from them? Thats kind of a confusing method\nKW: Yeah we definitely should learn from them. We should learn from us, Im tired of the \"us\" and \"them\", us meaning we should learn from human beings. The first thing I think were going to do to stop racism is stop focusing on racism. And I understand that its somebody going to work right now that has a white boss thats talking down to them because theyre black. Im not trying to deny that, but Im saying we understand that people is different races, its like light skinned against dark skinned. It just slows down the conversation, I dont know if its 8, excuse me for this statement\nCTG: It makes a great joke and stuff\nKW: yeah, yeah it does\nCTG: Especially on the light skinned\nEnvy: Shut up \nKW: Also every... people are human beings so everything this man says, when I talk to him pretty much everything he says is correct, but everything a person says is not gonna be correct. Every move a person makes is not gonna be well timed but sometimes those mistimed moves can inspire the next generation like Pac used to say. He said, \"I might not change the world but Ima inspire somebody that changes the world.\" When I think about, okay I wanna do surround vision, I wanna do my movie theatre, I wanna do my clothing line, I wanna do this, my goal is, man maybe theres a 4 year old thats gonna see that and cure cancer one day. Maybe we could keep... if your job is inspiration, you have to keep pushing that at all costs cause you never know whos gonna be inspired by that. And a lot of the reasons why Im successful now is the people who work with me now grew up on The College Dropout. You know, before when I was going in years ago, everyone they listened to rock, they liked Bruce Springsteen, like they dont even know about The College Dropout. So now they know what we brought to the table, and they wanna be a part of this, this movement in a way\nCTG: Last year when it was so much racial tension and you know the police brutality and stuff, like its almost like people wanted you to say something. Were you purposely falling back from being vocal about the Mike Brown situation and things like that?\nKW: Yeah my dad would email me and say stay out of it. My dad is like a thousand times smarter than me, and a thousand times more social than me. He like literally lived at a homeless shelter. He emailed me and told me stay out of it, thats my only parent, you know, so I have to listen to him, sometimes\nEnvy: Why, whyd he say that?\nKW: I think he was just trying to be protective of his son. You know, I cant run in front of every bullet. I just cant run in front of every single bullet\nCTG: Is it in the music with this album, maybe?\nKW: Oh yeah, we definitely... yeah, you know Im always gonna talk about whats going on, like Marvin Gaye would say. Its definitely gonna be in there\nAY: How much of this album is done?\nKW: Uh I think 80 percent, Im tryna get it finished. Im tryna get it to the people as soon as possible\nEnvy: How are you gonna release it? Is it gonna be like a...\nAY: Suprise?\nCTG: You cant have a release date, you cant do it, its played out. Its last years fashion, you cant do it\nKW: 100% release dates is played out, so the surprise is gonna be a surprise. There goes the surprise\nEnvy: No surprise\nCTG: Now one thing the hood all wants to know, where did that soft whisper Michael Jackson voice come from? It debuted on the Kris Jenner show a couple years ago\nEnvy: When did the hood wanna know that?\nAY: I dont think the hood watches that show\nCTG: Youve used it in more than that setting. Where did that come from? Is that like a... I dont know, youre in a shell? I dunno\nKW: Man dont, nobody wants, the worst thing... the thing that America doesnt want... America and the world, they antagonize black men. Black men arent intimate in their own country and theyre not in power and all this so you constantly get poked at. But the thing that they hate the most is the angry black man, even though they can cause you to be angry. They hate that, and you know, if you could just understand how to not get angry, in a boxing match, you know if you get angry, you lost. This is a match of life, a match of culture, and if Im angry all the time Ive already lost. So I just need to stop being angry. And people say, yeah what does he have to be angry about? I got enough to be happy about to focus on that, to not be angry about stuff, and plus it helps you work better, when Im calm\nEnvy: Now the hood wants to know, this is a barbershop question, does Beyoncé and Kim have a problem? Cause it seems like people pin them against each other\nCTG: Question mark, boom. Does Beyoncé and Kim have a problem?\nKW: Nah they love each other. They respect each other. When Beyoncés working on her album she has pictures of Kim on the wall because Kim represents powerful women. Kim be playing, whats the song, \"I know you care\", whats that song?\nCTG: \"7/11\"\nKW: Yeah, \"7/11\", playing that video, playing it for our daughter\nCTG: Kims not the only picture on the wall, right?\nKW: No its some other \nCTG: I was like \"thats weird\"\nKW: They definitely respect each other but its all... maybe theres a LeBron James - Kobe element to it but I aint say that... \nCTG: But theyre not even in the same lane, like Kim dont sing and shes not entertaining\nEnvy: In the bad mommy lane\nAY: The MILF lane, is that what youre tryna say?\nEnvy: I wasnt gonna say that... but theyre bad, beautiful mommy lane\nAY: When it comes to raising North West, does it concern you?\nAre you like, okay, obviously shes gonna be spoiled because were her parents, but does it concern you that you wanna make sure shes got some type of street sense or anything like that? Do you even think about that?\nKW: Yeah, my friends, we call them her uncles. Her uncles definitely gonna put her on and definitely. Its this toy, I wish I knew, whats the name of the brand of the toy, Gabe? Whats the name of the store we went to?\nGabe: Sweet William\nKW: Sweet William, they got these toys that my daughter got. Vanessa Beecroft that did the fashion show, she bought my daughter 3 wolves. Cause I would see toys that people would see and giver and Id be like, these toys is weak. She gotta have better toys than this. And sure enough, when she got these wolves from this toy store, she was going crazy, this the happiest Ive ever seen her right. So of course, me, Im gonna go and buy every single toy there. And I was just having a conversation with my wife yesterday like, we cant give her all these toys though. Cant just walk in and give her all the toys at once. Shes like, \"Well just give them all for her birthday.\" We cant give her, she cant have everything for her birthday. Were gonna have to piece this out. So I am very conscientious about the idea of someone being too spoiled cause I think Ive been spoiled in the past\nAY: Is that where the song, \"Wolves\" came from? Those wolves?\nKW: Im always thinking about wolves for some reason, thats always been on my mind\nCTG: Lets go back to Dame for a second\nKW: Im just gon go ahead and give yall a soundbyte that yall want, and Im just gon go ahead and say it, where the \"Wolves\" song came from. Im just gon go ahead and say it, cause maybe this will promote it happening, so Ima go ahead and put it out in the real world. The \"Wolves\" song came from a conversation that me and Drake had where we was gonna do an album together, and the album was called Wolves\nCTG: Jay wouldve been pissed off about that. Cause when Jay came here I asked him if he would ever do another album with an artist, I said Nas specifically and he said, \"No because me and Ye already started that.\"\nKW: Yeah, so and thats what happened. Me and Jay started talking about Watch the Throne and Drake went and did all the records with Wayne and the tour and we never did it but I just went out and put it in the, I put it out in the world\nCTG: Did you ask Drake?\nKW: Yall dont like it then yall can send it right back\nCTG: So you asked Drake to do an album?\nKW: Yeah I asked him and we talked about it and he said yeah we was gon do it and actually he was sending beats back and forth. You know, I got this one record with Young Thug that I think were gonna put on Rihannas album. I know Im giving a lot of information away today\nCTG: Thats what youre here for Ye\nEnvy: We appreciate it, thank you\nAY: Were excited\nCTG: Lets talk about you and Dame, does that effect you and Jays relationship now?\nKW: Nobodys relationship effects any relationship. Everybody need to just have a good relationship. If anything, we all helped each other at a certain point and we all see each other at a certain point\nCTG: Do you and Jay still have a good relationship? Cause you said that was your idol but you work hard so your idols become your rivals\nKW: I wouldnt be sitting here today right now if it wasnt for Jay. Jay helped me, period. In every single way that you can think. Whether it was like, holding me down when Im in New York, Im the dude in the pink Polo and the bad attitude. And Im still here. Jay Z\nAY: So is this Drake and Kanye album gonna happen?\nKW: I dont know, it might happen cause I threw it out there\nCTG: Dont do it, man\nKW: Hed probably be mad that I mentioned it on yall show since he dislikes yall so much\nEnvy: He hates him, the big black bully over there, he hates him\nCTG: So is it true that one time you were in a restaurant and when you had the pink, back in the pink Polo days, some dudes in New York were gon rob you?\nEnvy: Chelsea Diner, 14th Street\nCTG: And Beanie came through with the pistol and held you down?\nKW: Yeah thats true\nCTG: Do you feel like you may owe Beanie something for that?\nKW: Im not gonna put out some... Let me see\nCTG: Ye got media training. This is a new Ye, he thinks about things\nAY: He doesnt want to say something that could be misconstrued\nCTG: This is a new Ye!\nEnvy: Beans might still be on them papers, let me think about how Ima say this one\nKW: Okay I know this gon sound like a somewhat politically correct answer like one of these politician type answers but I owe every hip-hop artist in a way. And I dont mean for you to come to Houston Street and stand in front of my apartment and ask for beats and a verse or something like that. But I owe hip-hop. You know, just like, saying like, Ben Horowitz is the only VC out in San Fran that believes in rap. You know, he gave Nas a piece of Rap Genius and all that. You know, he used to be in a rap group. But, you know we all owe hip-hop. And I believe that I do have the ability, I believe that Ima be the head of the first trillion dollar company. And 100% when I get to that point, no rapper would ever have to worry about anything. My plan is to be coming one by one, Big Daddy Kane, here come his crib, everybodys crib\nCTG: Hip-hop reparations?\nKW: Yeah exactly, like the Forrest Gump moment after he got an apple and came to everybody. I owe every hip-hop artist because I wouldnt have made it this far without all of them. Look at my daughters name, thats hip-hop. Her names Nori!\nCTG: So you did name your daughter after N.O.R.E.?\nKW: Theres an element of that in there\nCTG: When N.O.R.E. heard \"Only One\", N.O.R.E. was tweeting, nah I think hes talking about his daughter. Like N.O.R.E. thought for a moment... he did! N.O.R.E. tweeted that!\nKW: \"Only One\" has nothing to do with Noreaga\nCTG: I didnt think so\nKW: It dont have nothing to do with Noreaga whatsoever, but everything else in my life does\nCTG: Lets talk about some of your artists for a second, like you got a close relationship with Drake, where at one point Pusha T and Drake had a little issue. And Pusha was hurt because you came out at OVO Fest\nKW: Yeah, we got over it. \nCTG: Kanye, new Kanye, Im telling you!\nEnvy: Teyana Taylor, whats going on with her?\nKW: She put out an amazing album\nCTG: Shes your artist, like shes very talented but it seems like you dont support her, like you dont stand by her like you should maybe\nKW: You know what, I dont support her enough. I need to do more. I need to rap on some remixes. I need to go shoot some videos. A lot of times it just, you know, when youre focusing on clothing, youre focused on your family, your focus is on all these different things, you know. Its hard to put all the focus, but yeah I do need to put some more focus on her. I havent put enough focus into her\nCTG: You are a true gentleman. Two weeks ago you were bumrushing the stage, calling out Beck, far from humble, and now youre humble as can be right now\nEnvy: It seems like love for the music, like you brought out Fetty Wap when he was performing at his show, whos a Jersey artist whos pretty new, and its telling me that youre back to that element of music again, and thats what people are excited about\nKW: Yeah and I was able to get... You know whats so funny is right after I did the fashion show I went to go shoot the \"Blessings\" video with Drake and Sean and I was so happy. I was so happy to be able to go do that. And I used to be resentful of having to do music. But because I was able to shit, now I can take a piss, you know its like somebody tells you do one you one...\nCTG: I usually piss first but I feel what youre saying\nKW: So you know Im just happy to just keep creating and just inspire people through joy and accomplishment. And like, with the Adidas thing, they gave me a little bit of oxygen. I couldnt breathe, yall was looking at a person suffocating. At least I got some ideas out. Maybe thats 10%, 5% of what I really wanna do, like I wanna be supported by Disney in the same way how Adidas supported me I want Disney Imagineering to support my ideas. In the same energy that fashion week had and the same front row and all that\nBob Iger, Im telling you, Ima bring that, I know, you know, right now our brands might not mix but Im a family man. Thank you for Frozen, thats like a second nanny\nAY: Youve been reluctant though to call yourself a designer - at what point will you say, \"I am a designer.\" Do you feel like there is gonna be a point or youre just a creator?\nKW: I dont even want to give myself any form of a title anymore. Im not calling myself a genius, Im not calling myself a visionary. The only thing I can say I am is a servant. I wanna serve, and if I can get a group of amazing designers together to create something to be able to serve the public, then thats my job. Im just a humble servant\nCTG: How do we know youre telling us the truth and youre not just being politically correct cause of your corporate connects?\nKW: Well you know Im never politically correct. I just speak from my heart of exactly where Im at at that time\nEnvy: Now recently you said when you first got with Kim you lost a lot of friends. Why was that and who? Who were your friends that you lost?\nKW: You know, when I said that in the interview, I said so-called friends\nAY: Yeah those were just fashion people that you were getting to know?\nKW: Yeah getting to know. Its all this, \"Oh should we let him sit at the table, should we not let him sit at the table?\" but there were some people in fashion that did stand by us. Theres Carine Roitfeld, theres Riccardo Tisci, even Anna Wintour, they were a part of the anti-KimYe movement. They were standing on the front line when there was an anti-KimYe movement, and now theyre here, every meeting, any meeting, any dinner they have, theyll be like, \"Man, see, I told yall\", like Riccardo dressed her, Carine put her on a magazine, Anna put her on a magazine. So that statement was a little bit out of context because it wasnt everybody, but there was a lot of people, and so be it, they was wrong and we was right\nAY: Do you hold grudges or are you cool to work with people even after that?\nCTG: You just know theyre fake, you know how to deal with them\nKW: Yeah I dont hold no, yeah Ive never held a grudge anyway\nCTG: You can see hes back here\nAY: They said after you left the station you were really flustered when you went to go see Sway and a lot of people were saying, \"Yall messed up his whole day after the interview with The Breakfast Club.\"\nKW: That was beautiful, man, at least that happened. At least the \"How Sway!?\", I know you was mad you aint get that part\nCTG: Id like the \"You aint got the answers, Charlamagne\"\nEnvy: That was a good one though, a good soundbyte\nKW: You got me suped up, you charged me up for that joint but you know what, its like he really didnt have the answers, you know, that was incorrect. That was incorrect, what he was saying. I could have said it in a calmer way but he was misinformed\nCTG: The only thing I was saying last time was those fashion people dont love you, so its like, why ask them for help? Youre Kanye, and as you can see, youre doing pretty okay for yourself\nKW: Well I needed that help because still now I got like... one of my head designers worked at Margiela for a while. One of... the girl who worked on the shoes worked at Celine. Ive been pulling that talent from a place that was only for the $4000 jacket lines to a place that were gonna be delivering shoes at $200, $100, we might get some shoes down to $60. I mean, we about to flip this whole thing on its head, its a new idea of apparel. And theyve got information, and I had to ask them, I had to be humble, I had to beg to go to dinners, and I had to explain to them, \"why should we work with you, Ye, how we know youre not just another celebrity thats gonna wear a red leather jacket and youre gonna diss us in public?\" Its been a long journey and now we gained some ground and now I can give some dope shit to the people. But these people are knowledgeable, man, they went to the Yale of fashion\nAY: These are the experts and youre trying to learn from them to get better in the fashion world\nKW: Yeah I hate when people be talking about, \"I just designed a restaurant\", you be like, \"Yeah it look like you designed this restaurant.\"\nCTG: Did you get backlash from E when you told Terrence J and Khloe take the E logos off. The Kardashians own a percentage of this\nKW: That was turnt, Im really happy I did that, man. That was like, really ignorant\nCTG: Did E give backlash, like, \"Kris control your son\" or something like that?\nKW: Yeah because they was happy cause they got more ratings and by the way, my opinion from someone thats knowledgeable, you know, whats offensive to me is overbranding, all that, thats too much. Thats not futuristic, thats in the now and in the past. They gotta be forward, man. We gotta promote forward ideas cause beauty is important. If beauty wasnt important, my wife wouldnt be so famous\nCTG: She dont get insulted when you say that?\nKW: What?\nCTG: You said at the afterparty that if it wasnt for beauty, the Kardashians wouldnt be famous. If I said that it could come off as insulting\nKW: But theyre beautiful, you know how many people wanna be that beautiful?\nCTG: But they dont have anything else? Brains?\nKW: Obviously they connect to some business sense because theyre all successful, family and all multimillionaires. One thing I think about with me is look how long its taking me to turn any of my friends to a multimillionaire. Kim did it like that. She did it out the gate, she was like, \" We gon take Khloe, we gon take Kourtney, we gon take Kourtneys boyfriend, we gon take the kids, we gon take this and we all gon be millionaires like that.\" Reality is like rap. Its so futuristic, its the new... my wife is a visionary at the end of the day. SNL wants to make skits and be like, \"What did you do, Kim?\" I dont know nobody else that is as successful at what shes doing as her\nCTG: I only got a couple more questions. Was \"Only One\" therapeutic for you? Like did it bring you to tears in the studio, maybe?\nKW: Yeah, yeah, 100% and it brought my wife to tears. Anybody I play it for. And people ask me why did I go \"Only One\" over \"All Day.\" \"Only One\" made me feel like me. It made me feel like this was the song I had to play back in the studio if CamRon and Jim Jones and whoever played 30 Dipset records, what am I gonna play to be the pink Polo? What am I gonna play thats gonna stand out? What point do I have? That was my problem, my issue I had once I got... which I love Cruel Summer, I think its amazing, but I felt like I started sort of blending in with the pack in a way, with a record like \"Clique\", which was a great song, we still perform it, but its important for me to innovate. Even with Drake, I think hell tell you, its important to have a Yeezus album, its important to have whatever this next thing is because you need vibes from all directions. You need innovators. My job in life is to innovate. I think that \"Only One\" is an innovative record, I think \"FourFive\" is an innovative record, I think \"Wolves\" is a less innovative but its the third proposition this year off the album. \"Wolves\" sounds like like 808s a bit, it sounds like signature Kanye post-808s, Drake whirl record. Thats a run-on, you got a proper run-on so you can say you understand what Im talking about\nCTG: The record sounds so personal and this may sound crazy but my grandmother who I loved dearly, she was my second mom, she passed away and I had a dream about her and it was like she was talking to me in my dreams. I wonder if you had like a vision of your mother speaking to you maybe, that caused that record\nKW: Yeah thats exactly what it is. I didnt realize I said, \"Hello my only one.\" Its literally like those movies you see where its like someones talking to you. I murmured that and I realized after the fact I said \"only one.\" And my name, Kanye, my mother named me that, it means only one. Thats the meaning of my name. Then, after the song was out, my cousin, Abigail, which I promise I got you some shoes, Im looking for a size 6, they run a little bit big, said you know that our grandmother, Mawmaw used to say \"Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord our soul to keep\" before she would put me to bed, and my grandmother actually named me Omari, which is the first line, \"Hello Mari.\" So I realized at that point that they were both talking to me. It wasnt just my mom, that my grandmother was speaking to me, these generations. So now Im working on a video game for \"Only One\" and the idea is its my mother going through the gates of Heaven and you gotta bring her to the highest gates of Heaven by holding her to the light. Weve been working on it for like 6 months\nCTG: Is that why you kept the lights low at the Grammys? Cause that was the first thing you performed and you felt like you might break down?\nKW: Nah it was supposed to be more smoke on it and the practice version was better and I wasnt completely satisfied with the visuals on the Grammys. Thats why I turnt up on the SNL visuals. I was like I aint playing, they gotta know I aint playing. These visuals gotta hurt!\nAY: Working with Paul McCartney, I read an article where they compare you to John Lennon. Has Paul McCartney ever said anything to you about that?\nKW: Nah but we talk about any and everything, but I do think that theres the angst that I feel from the world, the angst that I feel from what people are going through in Chicago, what people are going through financially, what people are going through with just... I feel like John felt like that. And when I got past the Gucci store, and got past how cool my jacket was, I finally was, like the song says, the \"man I always knew you could be.\" When I became a protector, a dad, a husband, I finally could stand up and stand for something\nEnvy: Well we appreciate you joining us, man\nCTG: THE NEW IMPROVED, MEDIA-TRAINED YE!\nEnvy: Kanye West, we appreciate you joining us, were glad you came back\nKW: Im happy to be here\nEnvy: I didnt think you was gonna come back and Charlamagne, man\nAY: I love that this started so different, he loves your new songs\nEnvy: Calmer guy, humbler guy\nCTG: Well listen, when I gave him Donkey of the Day last time, what did I say? I said a guy thats so easy to like, but he makes it hard to like him with just a couple antics. But thats part of being human, right?\nKW: Yeah\nEnvy: Ladies and gentlemen, its Kanye West! Its The Breakfast Club! Good morning!",

"I dont even know what he said, I just know that the Grammys, if they want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us. We aint finna play with them no more. \"***Flawless\", Beyoncé video. And Beck needs to respect artistry, and he shouldve given his award to Beyoncé. And at this point, were tired of it. Because what happens is, when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in their face after they deliver monumental feats of music, youre disrespectful to inspiration. We as musicians have to inspire people who go to work every day, and they listen to that Beyoncé album and they feel like it takes them to another place. Then they do this whole promotional event, theyll run the music over somebody’s speech, the artist, because they want commercial advertising. Like, no, we not playing with them no more. By the way, I got my wife, I got my daughter and I got my clothing line, so Im not going to do nothing to put my daughter at risk but I am here to fight for creativity.

"Bret Easton Ellis: Maybe it’s because movies seem more disposable now, and I’m just aching for that type of pleasure that you got with There Will Be Blood, but I find this year hard to get into. Has there been anything that you’ve recently seen that you’ve said “yes, that’s interesting, yes, that’s moving the dial over a little bit,” or?\nKanye: I mean, I’m gonna sound cliché again to say “Twelve Years of Slave” – it’s not that I only like black movies about black people. Of course, I love… Steve McQueens films are interesting. I think he is more about mood and story – even if he was more about story, it’s his mood and the way things look that really force a real opinion on how long he holds moments of emotion. Not just holding the shot – he holds moments of emotion. I’ve liked his growth from more of this art film approach to – not that that was even an attempt; that was just him doing what he was doing – now to something that’s finally grasped the ability to have commerciality. The word “commercial” has such a negative connotation, but Steve is such a fine artist too, as full exhibits at Basel show. To be able to tread those two worlds - I really admire that and think that is what the modern artist is about: having multiple talents and expressing those talents, especially in a world where you just get boxed into something. Even when I’ve done short films – every video I’ve done has basically been a short film, and “Flashing Lights” is my favorite because it has the best mood, feels the most like a film, has a storyline, bam it’s a surprise in there, it’s really like a short clip out of a film. It almost gives you a hint to what happened before and what happens after that.\nI did this film Runaway. There’s times where people see it and they’re moved by the emotion. They see the naiveté because I’m not trained at all. When I talk to Spike Jonez about it, he’ll be like “Oh, that completely sucks.” When I talk to an artist about it, he’ll say “Oh, that’s my favorite thing.” When I talked to Takashi Murakami about it, he said he cried when he saw it. Just explaining to people out there that are listening that maybe have some perception or have heard some brash comments that I have made like doing Disney or Steve Jobs comparisons… I have the right to do that, and I have the right to say that. And it’s fun for me, because like, to set your goals that high. Steve Jobs was never, you know, the best computer programmer, but he had an understanding and a feeling, and it’s exactly what you’re talking about – creating these moments that people connect with and maybe that are life changing. As we approach Hollywood or as I approach the clothing industry in the same way I approached the music industry with none of the boundaries of what this genre is supposed to be, what I’m supposed to be, what I’m supposed to be, what Im supposed to represent, what you wanna… It’s literally like a 14 year old’s emotion expressed. And you’re limited only by the people that you get to collaborate with.",

"CHILDISH GAMBINO & LUDWIG GORANSSON - TELEGRAPH AVE \nAt number 5 we start with the conceptually beautiful \"telegraph ave. . Partners in crime Donald Glover & Ludwig Goransson deliver an 808 bass line and intuitive use of equipment to snare a nostalgic sound. I had the pleasure of speaking to Goransson about the beat and he commented on the use of an iPhone microphone to capture Donalds voice, essentially making him sound like a sample. It worked wonders, the overlap of Donalds crooning on the aged sonics works a treat!\nNOAH \"40\" SHEBIB - TUSCAN LEATHERAt #4, Noah \"40\" Shebib literally flips the script on a Whitney Houston track for the intro to Drakes album Nothing Was The Same. The elaborate introduction is comprised of not two, but three different instrumentals as \"40\" flexes his full diversity as a producer. A new feature of Producer Genius includes an interactive Soundcloud breakdown, with such a complex beat be sure to check out the official Producer Genius breakdown here, just like 10,000 other people did!\nDON CANNON & KANYE WEST - NUMBERS ON THE BOARDSBallers, I put numbers on the boards!\nSpeaking to our very own Notero, Push detailed the aesthetic of the beat; explaining its similarity to RZA and Raekwons Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. Arguably the best \"traditional\" hip hop beat of the year, produced by Don Cannon & Kanye West; the raw, dirty knocking of the drums brings Push to a whole new level of wordplay. In the words of the King Pin:\nYou cant else you can do on that beat except rap on it.JUST BLAZE & BAAUER - HIGHER\nIn one of the most underrated bangers of the year, Just Blaze and Baauer team up and take our #2 spot. This extraordinary EDM track features banging drums, a shifting bass line and all the synths in the world. Just Blaze even convinced Hov to sample him on the track, creating an infectious hook to go with the instrumental. The video, directed by Nabil paints the perfect picture of an interesting piece of art, be sure to watch and follow the story!\nTNGHT, KANYE WEST & CO - BLOOD ON THE LEAVESIn undoubtedly one of the most controversial productions of the year, Kanye does what he does best and takes two polarising samples, mashes them together and creates something no one else could. The emphasis of Nina Simones rendition of \"Strange Fruit\", a song with deep racist connotations gives the instrumental depth while the blaring horns of TNGHT have \"Banger of the Year\" written all over them, perfectly complimenting the piano and well-synchronized drums!",

"You know, one connection that I have, you know, to, I believe everyone in this room, but especially with like me and Virgil and Don C and Fonzworth Bentley and all the people from the infamous Tommy Ton then transferred to South Park photo. Have dealt with in their life somehow, you know, being ridiculed for liking fashion. For that being a career you want to take up. Like even with the stylist that I work with that’s my.. I always call her my baby of M.A.S. . “You’re my M.A.S. and I’m your Nicholas.” And her brother’s a doctor. And somehow in her family she’s looked at like she didn’t do as much in her life ‘cause she did fashion and something. You know, and, she was the little girl that eight years ago showed me who Emmanuelle Alt was. Back when I was, you know, less informed about how to put my shit together\nAnd I honest.. I’mma jump to a point just so I don’t take too long. I believe that the world can be changed. The world can be saved through design. Through unselfish design. Through unselfish creation. You know, God is the number one creator. I’m a Christian, I’m not tryna push my opinions on anyone. But in my opinion God is the number one creator. And we, anytime we, you know, create, we’re extension of doing his work on Earth. While we’re here what can we do for humanity? And, you know, in a way, the fashion is what defines the time. People could think in some way they’re higher classes, some higher statuses that contribute more to the world because, you know, they work on bombs, they work at technology, they, you know, they school teachers. Whatever it is that seems to be somehow that type of profession that when you say it everybody is, “oh, you’re a lawyer? Oh great.. lawyer? Motherfucker.” No knock to lawyers, but you know what I’m talking about. So there are no movies without fashion. We define the times, we set in stone. What did 2015 mean? What did 2014 mean? You know? I always told Anna - “I wanna be in the middle of that conversation.” As we all know, The Devil Wears Prada was about Anna .. I said, “I wanna be in the middle of that conversation.” Nah, I’m saying.. we know this. So, where.. she was talking about the blue sweater. And previous to Instagram and all that type of shit do you know this conversation, “you think you not part of fashion because you don’t datatata.” Like the blue sweater, okay, you would know this. And somehow like me and my crew, you know, like all these straight, black guys from Chicago that no one knew why they were at the fucking show. You know, wanted to say, let’s make the conversation, you know, let’s make the conversation shorter between, you know, when the blue sweater goes from a Wang show to when it finally hit Kohl’s’ or something. Pre-Instagram, pre all that shit, pre people, you know, wanted to show what they had, before images were the new currency\nWhen we talk about, you know, I was talking to Rassi earlier and he was saying, you know, what his background was and you know, the way he appreciated all of his opportunities that he has like, to just being in America and being able to create. And I told him he had to arm wrestle with Virgil on like who is the greatest guy that I knew ‘cause he’s definitely one of the top. You know, one of these times when I look at like him and say “wow,” you know, I wish I could interact with people in the way that he interacts. I wish that I could believe in people unselfishly without, you know, worrying about how it may affect me, affects my reputation blabla, or all of what fashion is. Because I think that’s word fashion insiders, but everyone’s a fashion insider, you know. It’s illegal to be naked, everyone has some form of fashion, every single day. And I think it’s, the point I wanna make before I bring ‘em up, because I wanted to make this point to this room really.. you know, we have the power to change the world. I believe that through design ‘cause design is the closest to truth. Problem solving, truth is the closest to love, love is the closest thing to God and God is love. But we have to be unselfish in our approach which is the opposite of someone saying, “Kanye you can’t get in this show ‘cause you’re a celebrity” or some shit like that. You know, the way we embrace celebrity, the way, what Miley’s had to go through in the past couple years. Dealing with the fashion bigots and shit like that. I’m not gonna give you guys the speech that Tarantino gave at the Lacma, I’mma say what the fuck he should’ve really said, you know. The old guard accepting the new guard by letting down their guard. I don’t even know if I made one fucking good point\nBut what I wanna say is, this guy let me, a celebrity designer, work at Milk Studio when Adidas couldn’t figure out where my office was. We didn’t have windows, you know, it was cool, you know. We’d go out and get a cup of coffee, we stole a bunch of free cappuccinos from down the hallway. And I promised him that I was gonna be fucking good. It wasn’t about me being a celebrity ‘cause it could’ve been like, “what do you mean you got a celebrity designer working at Milk Studio? This is very authentic, blablabla..” All the shit. And he told me a story about this kid who stood on his steps and shit, you know, waiting for opportunities to design then went onto one day become the youngest American to run a French house called Balenciaga. That he believed in that kid back then, believing in, spending everything on Alexander Wang. And, I’m closing now. I don’t move, I don’t leave my fucking crib unless I really believe in someone. I don’t read the teleprompters blablabla. And I’m so happy that Jeremy is here ‘cause Jeremy asked me to come here also and Jeremy is another one of those bad motherfuckers that changed the game and always expressed himself. I’m not gonna say shit else. So all I’mma say is, I fucking love this guy and he sets an example to us as a humanitarian, as a visionary and as an innovator: Rassi",

"When your debut album, “The College Dropout” came out, the thing that people began to associate with you besides music was: Here’s someone who’s going to argue for his place in history; like, “Why am I not getting five stars?”\n I think you got to make your case. Seventh grade, I wanted to be on the basketball team. I didn’t get on the team, so that summer I practiced. I was on the summer league. My team won the championship; I was the point guard. And then when I went for eighth grade, I practiced and I hit every free throw, every layup, and the next day I looked on this chart, and my name wasn’t on it. I asked the coach what’s up, and they were like, “You’re just not on it.” I was like, “But I hit every shot.” The next year — I was on the junior team when I was a freshman, that’s how good I was. But I wasn’t on my eighth-grade team, because some coach — some Grammy, some reviewer, some fashion person, some blah blah blah — they’re all the same as that coach. Where I didn’t feel that I had a position in eighth grade to scream and say, “Because I hit every one of my shots, I deserve to be on this team!” I’m letting it out on everybody who doesn’t want to give me my credit.\n And you know you hit your shots.\n Yeah — you put me on the team. So I’m going to use my platform to tell people that they’re not being fair. Anytime I’ve had a big thing that’s ever pierced and cut across the Internet, it was a fight for justice. Justice. And when you say justice, it doesn’t have to be war. Justice could just be clearing a path for people to dream properly. It could be clearing a path to make it fair within the arena that I play. You know, if Michael Jordan can scream at the refs, me as Kanye West, as the Michael Jordan of music, can go and say, “This is wrong.”\n You’ve won a lot of Grammys.\n“ Dark Fantasy” and “Watch the Throne”: neither was nominated for Album of the Year, and I made both of those in one year. I don’t know if this is statistically right, but I’m assuming I have the most Grammys of anyone my age, but I haven’t won one against a white person.\nBut the thing is, I don’t care about the Grammys; I just would like for the statistics to be more accurate.\n You want the historical record to be right.\n Yeah, I don’t want them to rewrite history right in front of us. At least, not on my clock. I really appreciate the moments that I was able to win rap album of the year or whatever. But after a while, it’s like: “Wait a second; this isn’t fair. This is a setup.” I remember when both Gnarls Barkley and Justin lost for Album of the Year, and I looked at Justin, and I was like: “Do you want me to go onstage for you? You know, do you want me to fight” —\n For you.\n For what’s right. I am so credible and so influential and so relevant that I will change things. So when the next little girl that wants to be, you know, a musician and give up her anonymity and her voice to express her talent and bring something special to the world, and it’s time for us to roll out and say, “Did this person have the biggest thing of the year?” — that thing is more fair because I was there.\n But has that instinct led you astray? Like the Taylor Swift interruption at the MTV Video Music Awards, things like that.\n It’s only led me to complete awesomeness at all times. It’s only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness. Beauty, truth, awesomeness. That’s all it is.\n So no regrets?\n I don’t have one regret.\n Do you believe in the concept of regret?\n If anyone’s reading this waiting for some type of full-on, flat apology for anything, they should just stop reading right now.\n But that is something that you apologized for.\n Yeah, I think that I have like, faltered, you know, as a human. My message isn’t perfectly defined. I have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure.\n...\n That’s fascinating, to look at that record through that lens.\n I don’t have some type of romantic relationship with the public. I’m like, the anti-celebrity, and my music comes from a place of being anti. That was the album where I gave people what they wanted. I don’t think that at that point, with my relationship with the public and with skeptical buyers, that I could’ve done “Black Skinhead” \n Does that make “Dark Fantasy” a dishonest album in some way?\n It’s always going to be 80 percent, at least, what I want to give, and 20 percent fulfilling a perception. If you walk into an old man’s house, they’re not giving nothing. They’re at 100 percent exactly what they want to do. I would hear stories about Steve Jobs and feel like he was at 100 percent exactly what he wanted to do, but I’m sure even a Steve Jobs has compromised. Even a Rick Owens has compromised. You know, even a Kanye West has compromised. Sometimes you don’t even know when you’re being compromised till after the fact, and that’s what you regret.\nI don’t want to come off dissing “Dark Fantasy.” It’s me never being satisfied and then me coming and admitting and saying the truth. As much as I can air things out for other people, to air things out for myself, to say, “I feel like this could’ve been stronger.”\n...\n Even though you had always wanted to be out in front, was there ever a point where you valued your anonymity?\n Yeah, I held on to the last moments of it. I knew when I wrote the line “light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson” I was going to be a big star. At the time, they used to have the Virgin music , and I would go there and just go up the escalator and say to myself, “I’m soaking in these last moments of anonymity.” I knew I was going to make it this far; I knew that this was going to happen.\n But producting happened for you first, especially after Jay-Z used you so heavily on “The Blueprint.”\n I used to have tracks that sounded like Timbaland; I had tracks that sounded like . But Jay-Z was an amazing communicator that made the soul sound extremely popular. And because I could make the soul sound in my sleep, it finally gave me a platform to put the message that my parents put inside of me and that Dead Prez helped to get out of me and Mos Def and Kweli, they helped to get out of me: I was able to put it, sloppily rap it, on top of the platform that Jay-Z had created for me.\nBefore, when I wanted to rap, my raps sounded like a bit like Cam’ron; they sounded a bit like Mase; they sounded a bit like Jay-Z or whoever. And it wasn’t until I hung out with Dead Prez and understood how to make, you know, raps with a message sound cool that I was able to just write “All Falls Down” in 15 minutes.\n Is that true?\n Yeah, that’s how I discovered my style. I was just hanging out with them all the time in New York. I would produce for them. You know, I was able to slip past everything with a pink polo, but I am Dead Prez. And now, because I was able to slip past, I have a responsibility at all times.\n What were the things that you were trying to do on “Late Registration” that you either did not or could not yet do on “Dropout”?\n I was trying to do different things with orchestras. It was just a vibe that I was trying to get at, a sound I was trying to mix with hip-hop to try to see how far I could expand it. I guess that was a Chicago thing, like Quincy Jones.\n But you came here, you worked with Jon Brion .\n I really liked the sound of some projects that Jon Brion had worked on. I was always considered this crazy hothead kid, but I would always just go and just really break bread with someone who I respected. I will completely bow to anybody I respect.\n That era also includes what I find probably the most moving thing that you’ve ever done, which is calling out President Bush at the Hurricane Katrina telethon. To me, that moment is actually the peak of putting a message in a pop format, even though it’s not a song.\n Yeah. I guess it’s a very pop moment of a lifetime or generation. I mean, my dad’s generation is a generation of messaging, you know? But that’s just a piece of me being the opinionated individual that I am.\n Were you conscious that that’s what you were doing, or was it totally just instinct?\n Yeah, it was pretty bugged out. When you think about it, I was wearing like, a Juicy Couture men’s polo shirt. We weren’t there, like, ready for war.\n...\n You look at Jay or Diddy, and I’d say like, 90 percent of the time, you think they’re having a good time. With you, I would say, I don’t know, 50-50 maybe? Or 30-70?\n Maybe 90 percent of the time it looks like I’m not having a good time.\n But you’re in a very public relationship, a seemingly long and satisfying relationship: you’re about to have a child.\n Any woman that you’re in love with or that loves you is going to command a certain amount of, you know, energy. It’s actually easier to focus, in some ways.\n When you’re uncertain about love, it can be such a distraction. It infects all the other areas.\n Yeah, that’s what I mean when I say like, “Yo, I’m going to be super Zenned out like, five years from now.” I’m the type of rock star that likes to have a girlfriend, you know? I’m the type of soul that likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus. And that inspires me.\n On “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” there’s a really affectionate scene where you go and help Kim sort through her clothes.\n That was from a place of love. It’s hard when people read things in a lot of different ways. You know, the amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore. And it’s not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get. Because I just see like, an amazing person that I’m in love with that I want to help.\n...\n One of the things I thought when I heard the new record was, “This is the anti-College Dropout.’ ” It feels like you’re shedding skin. Back then, you were like: “I want more sounds. I want more complicated raps. I want all the things.” At what point did that change?\n Architecture — you know, this one Corbusier lamp was like, my greatest inspiration. I lived in Paris in this loft space and recorded in my living room, and it just had the worst acoustics possible, but also the songs had to be super simple, because if you turned up some complicated sound and a track with too much bass, it’s not going to work in that space. This is earlier this year. I would go to museums and just like, the Louvre would have a furniture exhibit, and I visited it like, five times, even privately. And I would go see actual Corbusier homes in real life and just talk about, you know, why did they design it? They did like, the biggest glass panes that had ever been done. Like I say, I’m a minimalist in a rapper’s body. It’s cool to bring all those vibes and then eventually come back to Rick , because I would always think about Def Jam.\n His records did used to say “reduced by Rick Rubin.”\n For him, it’s really just inside of him. I’m still just a kid learning about minimalism, and he’s a master of it. It’s just really such a blessing, to be able to work with him. I want to say that after working with Rick, it humbled me to realize why I hadn’t — even though I produced “Watch the Throne”; even though I produced “Dark Fantasy” — why I hadn’t won Album of the Year yet.\nThis album is moments that I haven’t done before, like just my voice and drums. What people call a rant — but put it next to just a drumbeat, and it cuts to the level of, like, Run-D.M.C. or KRS-One. The last record I can remember — and I’m going to name records that you’ll think are cheesy — but like, J-Kwon, “Tipsy.” People would think that’s like a lower-quality, less intellectual form of hip-hop, but that’s always my No. 1. There’s no opera sounds on this new album, you know what I mean? It’s just like, super low-bit. I’m still, like, slightly a snob, but I completely removed my snob heaven songs; I just removed them altogether.",

"MCQUEEN: Youve been on the scene as an artist now for 10 years, which is impressive, given the level of interest and artistry that youve managed to sustain in your work. In the process, youve become incredibly influential. So you talk about doing all of these other things, which is great, but theres really no amount of money that could make you more influential than you are now. So my question is: What are you going to do with all of the influence that you have right now?\nWEST: Well, influence isnt my definition of success—its a by-product of my creativity. I just want to create more. I would be fine with making less money. I actually spend the majority of my money attempting to create more things. Not buying things or solidifying myself or trying to make my house bigger, or trying to show people how many Louis Vuitton bags I can get, or buying my way to a good seat at the table. My definition of success, again, is getting my ideas out there. The first company that has really given me a shot is Adidas. They did the deal ... I mean, Damon Dash did the deal, at the end of the day. He signed Kanye West 12 years ago. What does that mean now? What does that mean to music? You know, people say things about creativity and jobs and every 10 years, blah, blah, blah. But I dont have a desire to not continue making music. When I left Chicago and moved to New York, it wasnt because I didnt love Chicago; it was because I needed to go to New York. So right now, Ive got other innovations and other thoughts that I want to pursue. As I was saying earlier, I create like a 3-year-old. When youre 3, you wake up one morning and say, \"I wanna ride a bike.\" And then the next day, you wake up and say, \"I wanna draw.\" I dont want to be in a situation where, because I was good enough at riding a bike one day, then thats all I can do for the rest of my life. I mean, you know firsthand, being a fine artist and then moving into the Hollywood space ... You know, I say to Renzo Rosso, Bernard Arnault, and François-Henri Pinault, the heads of Diesel, LVMH, and Kering, \"Come to my show and look at the mountain I made. Look at these 20,000 people screaming, and then tell me I dont deserve to design a T-shirt.\" If I want to design a T-shirt in my lifetime, then please help me do it! People say, \"Well, why dont you just do it on your own?\" Are you telling me to sew every single T-shirt? People say, \"Why do you antagonize the high-end companies and your fan base?\" and this and that. But what Im saying is that in working with partners like Louis Vuitton and Zanotti and Balmain and Fendi like I have—and please forgive me for using film as a metaphor because I hate when people do that with music—I feel like its a better form of film that Im working with when I work with them. Im working with better cameras. Im working with better editors ... Steve, please forgive me because I feel like its super-patronizing whenever someone does an analogy or a metaphor that relates to the field that you currently work in\nMCQUEEN: No, not at all\nWEST: Im sorry. I find it super-insulting whenever people give me a music analogy. Its like, \"You know, I would have understood it if you just said it in English. You didnt have to put it in music terms, like you somehow know more about music or I would understand it better if it were in music terms.\" So please forgive me for putting that in film terms. I mean, talking about film to Steve McQueen ...\nMCQUEEN: I grew up in Europe, in London, and you grew up in the States. When was the first time you came to Europe? Do you remember?\nWEST: I think it was when Damon Dash had me and some other Roc-A-Fella artists come over. He stressed the importance of connecting with London, especially. Then we went to France, and I hated France when we first went there. Now, of course, I love it. But at the time, there was a rapper out of Chicago who wanted me to show up at some event of his, and he was trying to threaten me in some way physically if I didnt show up because we had done a record together. And Dame Dash had to man-up on the situation and apply a bit of gangster to have them fall back, just for me to be able to get on that first flight to London\nMCQUEEN: Its interesting how when Malcolm X ventured out of the United States for the first time, he went to Europe, he went to Africa, he went to Mecca, and then, when he came back to America, he realized that, to some extent, for him, it wasnt about black or white, it was about people. In talking to you now, it seems like you feel the same way—that its never really been about race for you, but at the same time, it has very much been about that, if you know what I mean\nWEST: My mission is about what I want to create. Its for people, for humanity. Its about things that can make the world better. Im not saying that Im going to make a better world; Im just saying that I will provide some things that will help, and my glass ceiling that Im facing is based on my color. You know, I was looking at some cheesy-ass MTV videos a while ago, and it was so funny because it was like, \"Wow, these videos are pre-Michael Jackson\"—and people forget that Michael Jackson had to fight to get on MTV because he was considered to be an urban artist. This was, like, the greatest pop star of all time, and they told him, \"Were not gonna play your video because it doesnt fit our format.\"\nMCQUEEN: It actually stunned me to find out that youve never won Best Album at the Grammys. I suppose I shouldnt be surprised, but its kind of odd, considering what youve done in music over the last decade\nWEST: I wasnt even nominated for Best Album this year. This year, I only got two nominations by the Grammys: for Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song\nMCQUEEN: Well, thats my problem with all this stuff. Its ghettoization—and Im talking about country as much as rap. Its all just music. And Ive got a problem with people kind of trying to categorize it, where its either good or its bad. I find it all odd, to be honest. Have you ever been nominated for Best Album?\nWEST: Ive been nominated for Best Album maybe three times. I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne less than a year apart and neither of them got nominated. \"Ni**as in Paris\" wasnt nominated for Best Song either. But lets go into the fact that I have the most Grammys of any 36-year-old or 40-year-old or whatever, and Ive never won a Grammy outside of the Rap or R&B categories. \"Jesus Walks\" lost Best Song to some other song; \"Ni**as in Paris\" wasnt nominated in that category. But those are the labels that people want to put on you. People see you in a certain way, so if I was doing a clothing line that had rock tees in it or whatever we just did for the \"Yeezus\" tour, which sells $400,000 of stuff in two days ... You know, I like Shame as much as 12 Years a Slave, but Hollywood likes the idea of a black director directing 12 Years a Slave more than it likes the idea of a black director directing Shame",

"I still remember when Damon Dash asked me to put Kanye on Def Poetry Jam. I didn’t really know Kanye as a poet, I just knew him as a producer who was part of the Roc-A-Fella crew, making hit records for Jay and ‘em. His appearance on our HBO show blew a lot of people away that night, including me…and from that point on, Kanye soared.\nI recently sat down with Ye in New York and got the chance to hear about his hopes and ambitions, his frustrations and contradictions, his happiness and his anger. But through it all, what I felt from Kanye was an artist who desperately wants to leave his imprint in the history books. What’s often times misunderstood about Kanye is that people believe he wants all of this for himself, in fact, quite the opposite, he wants all of this for the rest of us. He wants to destroy the glass ceiling with 808′s and crack music…so one day WE have the power to see all of the lights. Certainly he wants a piece for himself…everybody would, but at his core, at the bottom of his heart, lies an inner-truth that has led to an external battle to make this world a bit easier for those who have been dealt a hand of struggle, by showing them a glimmer of hope through his art.\nIt is his generation that has this power. He knows it. He feels it. He tastes it. And he so badly wants it like mad. So, you may think he’s mad when he goes on his “Yeezy rants,” but it is a different kind of mad. It is a mad that keeps you up at night, knowing that if you fall asleep, you are wasting time. It is a mad that makes you go into the lab and work seven days with no sleep, cause you want to perfect your craft. It is a mad that sees the world still unfair for women and people of color, that makes you want to break down every door that they say is locked and can never be open. It is a mad-scientist kind of mad. One who wants to uplift his people to the top of the mountain, so in unison, they can chant from the top of their lungs, “No One Man Should All That Power!” He is fighting for his generation, his people, his country, his planet earth….like a motherfuckin’ monster!\nWe will no longer be lost in the world and we will survive in this America. I believe these truths to be self-evident. That is what Kanye West told me on a cold morning in New York City just seven days ago. It is his genius, his tenacity, his creativity, his relentlessness and his madness, that will allow us all to one day have the ability to touch the sky.\n-Russell Simmons",

"This is my problem with interviews, you know. What if you did music and someone else could come in and change your words around and then release it to the radio? And you dont even get a chance to listen to it before they dropped it to radio. Thats how interviews are. You, you say what you say and then youll get paraphrased and then theyll do shit like, if you say a joke, most jokes are inappropriate. Theys, theyre like fucked up things that you say but its kind of funny the way you word em. And if you take away, you know, the setup or the punchline, you just sound absolutely crazy. Which is, they love to do that because I love to joke and I give them too much and then my shit dont be like all dry ass interviews and stuff, like I dont have media training or whatever. And then, so they take that, and I, and I told Gabe, I said look, well I wanna, I wanna do uh, I wanna get approval over the shit, just because I wanted to be as entertaining as possible, I want people to have the information. And you know, like a lot of magazines, they got real uptight, they like, \"no you ont get approval, you ont get approval, you dont get approval.\" So, you know, when I say the line bout The Rolling Stone, I dont have a problem with Rolling Stone. I really appreciate the fact that they did put me on the magazine and I realize that you know I was halfway out of my mind for the past two years and shit. I was, you know, off that drug called fame and shit like that, I was really like, I was like a little crazy, you know what Im sayin, like Ive calmed down and shit and like come back to Earth. So, you know, for the editor of Rolling Stone, I wanted to say that. But I do wanna say that it was pieces of the article that was, information in the article that was incorrect. And you know, if you allowed me to proofread it, the people couldve had the proper information. And just to speak to the Dave LaChapelle, cause Dave LaChapelles one of my favorite photographers, modern-day Warhol. I wanna speak to the cover. You know, people say, \"Okay well he has a god complex.\" Fam if someones in college and they do like a play where they emulate Christ, do they have a god complex? Are they allowed to do that? You know, its because of my position, its like Im not allowed to be creative. So every cover I take has to just be a picture of my face and shit, just... look its my face! Its me! And sometimes its like after you see—after I see me so much, I get tired of me and shit... I gotta look at me every day! I wanna do shit thats exciting to me. So the Rolling Stones cover was exciting to me, that shit went down in history. I did it purely for creative reasons, it wast speaking upon you know, anything disrespectful to Christianity, to anything like that. It was something I did purely creative. Lot of times I do shit and people take more out of it. You know like I said Bush doesnt care about Black people and then people took it and said, \"Well you said, \"Bush hates Black people.\"\" You know, everybody takes it and makes it what they want it to be. When you know, I just say, I express something. You know, the other day somebody came to me like, \"Okay well who you voting on? Barack or Hillary?\" And Im like Im not really political dawg, Im not getting into like you know Im taking sides and this type of thing. Hes like, \"What do you mean youre not political? Youre not...\" I was like, fam! Im emotional! Im social! Im like... Im an artist! Like if you give me the opportunity, Im like the fan that got too close to the stage and shit. Im the glitch in the matrix, Im like the last person to say, yo I really feel... I know Im supposed to feel like this and know Im supposed to read this teleprompter or whatever, but I feel like this what I wanna say. That doesnt put me... Im never going politically incorrect or anything. I dont know about politics like that. I just know about people. I make music for people",

"PARIS — Fashion has a new odd couple: Bernard Arnault and Kanye West\nThe luxury titan turned out Saturday night for an impromptu concert by West in the auditorium of his Fondation Louis Vuitton, the new Frank Gehry art destination that later this month will put on display Edvard Munch’s “The Scream,” Henri Matisse’s “Dance” and other modern masterpieces\nWest drew a crowd packed in like sardines — the kind that hold cell phones — to hear him proclaim, “I wanna thank my original family for having me this evening, the LVMH group,” as he ripped into a version of “Runaway,” the lyrics of which include the refrain, “Let’s have a toast to the jerk-offs/That’ll never take work off.”\nThe young crowd went wild, with Oscar-winning film director and video artist Steve McQueen twirling his scarf over his head up in the VIP box\n“He’s great,” Arnault said after the show, giving a thumbs-up sign and heading to West’s dressing room to offer congratulations, his classical pianist wife Hélène and four of his five children in tow\nIt was Alexandre Arnault, 22, formerly a DJ, who pulled off the four-night attraction in the middle of Paris Fashion Week. “We organized it in two days,” he said\nThe student and budding luxury executive, who already works on LVMH’s digital strategy, related that West also offered to premiere his new music video, “All Day,” directed by McQueen\n“You saw the film? Fantastic,” Bernard Arnault told a reporter before the concert, which also featured an exhibition of West portraits by photographer Jackie Nickerson\nMcQueen related how the project came about\n“Me and my daughter were shopping in London at Dover Street Market and I got a phone call from Kanye and he says, ‘I’m at Dover Street Market, where are you?’ and I said, ‘Hey, I’m at Dover Street Market,’” he recalled. “I always said I would never shoot a music video, and here we did one in 10 days. That’s Kanye: It’s been a wild ride.”\nThe director said West played him his entire forthcoming album, “So Help Me God,” and he decided to blend elements of two tracks, shooting the video at Chatham Dockyard, with West donning a vintage T-shirt, Acne Jeans and his new Kanye West x Adidas Originals Yeezy high-tops\nIn an interview after his performance, his wife Kim Kardashian curled up on a sofa manipulating her iPhones, West was unequivocal about how fashion shows, particularly in Paris, nourish his creativity\n“As a musician, I would have never been able to design a show like what you saw tonight if it hadn’t been for my experience in Paris — learning how to minimize and make design decisions, how we started with just the single light,” said West, a stickler for details who barked at security guards between songs for loitering in front of the giant screens surrounding the stage, upon which images of boiling clouds, waterfalls, stars and smoky forests were projected. “It’s part of the show,” he pleaded\nWhile a divisive figure in fashion — many are put off by his front-row ubiquity and often surly behavior — West clearly relishes his role as a cultural lightning rod where style, art and music intersect. The hip-hop artist lauded the creative people “that work here, the city itself, the music that’s played at the shows, the colors, the palettes. I actually get a lot that I take back and put into music.”\nWest’s ties to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton stretch back to 2006, when he performed at a Fendi event in Tokyo, later collaborating with Louis Vuitton on a sneaker range in 2009\nMore recently, after meeting at a Givenchy show, West struck up a friendship with Alexandre Arnault, who doffed his Dior Homme jacket at the show and bopped around with his friends, mouthing the words to songs on the playlist, which included “All of the Lights” and “Ni–as in Paris.”\nA tour of the foundation building sparked the concert idea. “When I saw it, I was just so in love with architecture and the modern space and the way they curated the art. I just asked would it be OK for me to do a performance there,” West said\nTickets for the four concerts, which end Tuesday, sold out quickly at 100 euros, or $113, a pop. West said all proceeds would go to charity\nMeanwhile, Kardashian had spent part of Saturday at the hairdresser to adjust the color on her new blonde locks, which had assumed a yellow cast, not the platinum she was after\n“He fully got the color right. And it’s so perfect, I’m like, ‘Don’t make me fly out to Paris every time I need to color my hair,’” she said with a smile. “I’m happy with it. It’s a look. But I have a couple of shoots coming up and everyone is like, ‘Huh, what’s going on?’”\nKardashian said Madonna was partly the inspiration\n“I’ve always had references of Madonna with platinum hair. They’ve been on my computer forever, ” she said, letting slip that she would keep the color for an upcoming campaign, but clammed up on the brand\nLike West, Kardashian keeps a rein on her image, noting that the black coat slung over her shoulders at the concert, which she took off as the heat intensified, was a Céline style she altered to her liking, making it slimmer, changing the color from white to black, and adding a fur collar\n“My mom has the one that’s just as is. So I feel like mine’s a little special,” she said\n“And now it’s a really dope coat,” West concurred",

"I like that because I thought youre on the way to doing things differently, all the promotion around your album. It was really like just awesome to me, because it wasnt the traditional roll out that they do to radio where they send the single and then theyre doing is theyre doing that and, you know, youre doing an appearance on, you know, whatever TV show. But it was really cool. It was like when you showed in over 60 cities. You showed the-- you know, I wouldnt even call them videos. It was more of like a-- just an art exhibition that you did in these different cities. It is kind of, \"Whats spurred that, to do it that way?\"\nI mean, we have dreams. We wake up, and we make them happen. I appreciate that my label allowed me to go unorthodox with that. And theres people at the label who appreciate it and theres people who dont appreciate that. Its like non-traditional in that way. But I have to push. And really, its all practice to me. Being a musician is practice. Life is practice. You know, so its not like a in go-- so Im fine to make a mistake. Im fine to, like, put out an auto tune album that no one understands. Im fine to put out a complete punk new wave album that no one understands. Im not trying to maintain, you know, some spot in the hip-hop charts on radio or something like that. Im trying to open up peoples minds. I want people to think more. I want people to feel like its okay to create. I want people to feel like its okay to make mistakes in front of people and follow what their dreams are and not feel boxed in. I want people to feel like, you know, awesome is possible. I want them to, you know, feel like, you know-- its not a matter of just even what Im doing at DONDA. Its the amount of people that are hearing me and now theyre going to fight to get the best ideas out. Because the world will only be saved through good intention and design, Its not going to be saved is politics. The irony is, what holds things back? Politics! So how could that push things forward?\nI heard you say that you were trying to work out a deal with the Gap and politics held you back from doing that with your merchandise for the tour, and it may be just wonder what, sort of-- elaborate on that. What are you talking about when you say \"politics?\"\nI mean it, like, what would happen if I was able to design a collection and was like backed by the Gap? It would be awesome, right?\nIt would totally be awesome, but then my question for you is, but you have-- youre not hurting. Youre doing well, so couldnt you just do that yourself? You dont need the Gap.\nNo, you cant. You need the infrastructure. Its not a matter of just having money.\nBut you have a great staff set up in everything, I feel like...\nNo, I dont have a great staff at all. That is a skill set that takes years and years of anything. If I wanted to get into the coal business and I had-- and also, \"well-off\" is that, that is-- whats the word Im looking for? Im trying to use the simplest word sometimes. Yeah, its all relative. Because Im not, because, okay-- I could make an amount that seems, like, really crazy to people, like 10 million a year, right? To open up a new fashion company might costs 15 million. So if I went and took all the money I had and I invested it into trying to do it like that, it could leave me 5 million in debt.\nThats fair enough, I get that.\nAnd then youre not well-off.\nThats-- yeah-- Im sorry, I know its not all about money, but Ive just been saying that the team that you have at DONDA and-- I would think that you could hire anybody that may want to come and work for you.\nIll-- now we are. Because of what were doing. Because of the way were turning up. Now we can get real designers, real infrastructure. But its really hard. Just as much as, you know, getting a creative person is hard, its hard to get the back office guys; the people that run the-- who do the real work. Yeah, you get the Rihannas, the Big Seans, the Kanyes, but you need the Barry Weiss, the Steve Barlows and , and like these people, you know, all the people all the people who get mentioned on the Grammy speeches, and you just cant, thats-- what youre saying is like-- Okay, youre a major recording artist because you signed to a major label. Cant you just do independent clothing? The answer is, \"No.\" Now, cant you just get a clothing deal from a major label? The answer is, also, currently is, \"No.\" And thats the issue. Thats the Truman Show wall. Thats the glass ceilings. Thats the Michael Jackson cant get his video played. Because everybody-- nobody is looking at what Obama is wearing. Im the number one most influential person on the globe in fashion. is a great designer. I love Saint Laurent and their $1 million dollar jackets and everything. I love it. But, I should have backing from one in the majors. Louis Vuitton group which is Bernard Arnault, Karen group, which is France Rapinoe, or Renzo Rosso, who owns Diesel and Margiela. Bottom line. And thats the only way its going to be, because the thing is, when you try to go, you know, when you go less that, the level of the product is just isnt where should be. Yeah Im doing T-shirts that are amazing. We put all our design into it, and so many people like T-shirts. And I love that. I get people T-shirts. But I also want to create entire gyms. Like gyms. Like I want to make a gym. I wanna make a store. I want to do apartment complexes. I want to build cities. I want to be involved with hyperloop when it comes to reality, with Eli Musk. Thats the conversation I want to be in. So I will not be held into a box of being a musician, or that you get it somehow confused. I dont look like a rapper. Now rappers look like me, but when I started, I wasnt gangsta enough. You know what Im saying? Like, Im getting married to Kim Kardashian, and Ive never played in the NBA.\n[Michelle\nOh my god.\nSo, thats thought.\nYou know, you raise a really good point here. If you just joined us, Im Michelle and were live on 97.1 Radio Los Angeles with Kanye West. You know, in creativity in rap music, do you think that, because I dont-- you definitely dont do things like everybody else. Do you think theres a certain lack of originality and creativity, not, you know, Im not going to say that for all rap, but it seems like you do things a little differently. And a love that that; with music, I mean.\nTheres a lack of creativity in every field, because people are afraid. Because the powers control people. And the only place where people can be fully creative is in Silicon Valley. Everything else, theres an old regime. And oligarchs are controlling whether or not youre going to be able to feed your kids. So no one can say the type of stuff that Im saying because theyll lose their job.\nThere is a a lack in creativity in Hollywood. Theres a lack in creativity in clothing. Theres a lack creativity in the education system. Theres a lack in creativity on the globe period! @hen you look up and look at billboard ads, the majority of them suck. Theres a lack creativity in advertising, in agencies. Theres just a lack, because the person with the good idea needs to pay dues for 20 years before their positioned to say the idea, and they might not have the relevancy anymore. Right now, I have the relevancy and I have the perspective and I have the voice and Im going to scream as loud as I can. And aint nothing gon happen to me except success.\nYoure here to save it, man. At least, like, change it, which I love. Whoo! That heat, I love that.\nTheres so much passion because I share a lot of the same-- where the view is my passion, and I feel like people dont always get it. You know, and theyre like, \"Gosh, its kind of harsh\" with everyone. Youve just got to be true to yourself. You know? I got to-- by the way, before I forget, you know with your clothing and your fashion, we were just talking about your merch line.\nReally quick, and dont forget your question, please. I wanna stop using the term \"fashion,\" because Eve made Adam bite an apple. And since then, its been illegal to be naked. Im helping people follow the law in style. Im helping people with their opinion on how to follow the law. This isnt about fashion. Im creating new standards, things so you dont have to think about it. Fashion is too high of a skill set. It just needs to be easy. Easy as the hoodie and jeans that Im wearing. And Ill do all the hard work. Ill figure out exactly where that collar goes and exactly where that hoodie sits and-- and how many times you can wash that fabric and stuff so that it looks better 5 years from now. Ill do the hard work for you. Fashion is forcing people to do all this hard work where you look back 2 years from now and say, \"That looked crazy!\"\nThere are certain things that are just standard. A suit jacket is a suit jacket is a suit jacket. A hoodie is a hoodie is a hoodie. Jeans are jeans are jeans. And a Michael Jordan sneaker is a Michael Jordan sneaker. Now, lets take our kids to the park. Its not about fashion. Its about life, and me helping it become more awesome...",

"April 15th, 2018\nSome people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness. often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and friends.\nApril 17th, 2018\nAs a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency. You have to protect your ability to create at all cost. try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas.\ndistraction is the enemy of vision. Sometimes you have to get rid of everything.\neverything you do in life stems from either fear or love. Fear often causes people to be manipulative. be transparent as possible. Stop setting plays. Stop playing chess with life. Make decisions based on love not fear.\ntrend is always late\nApril 18th, 2018\nwhen you first wake up dont hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. Its better than any movie.\nYou have the best ideas. Other peoples opinions are usually more distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you dont absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can. Dont follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.\nI dont believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You dont have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you. You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then its just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness. just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.\nin life, we are all trained actors. When were born were ourselves and then one of the first things were thought is how to act. If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and cant express himself in a conventional manner. everyone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to \"the simulation\". Parents are our first acting coaches.\nme and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.\nBe here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see. Theres love stories. Pain happiness. Its 3 dementional. Theres taste touch sound. Its the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both.\ntoo much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update. Cars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. Its amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... its a hoodie 🤷‍♂️ I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like \"this person stole this from me\" and the funny thing is itll be a reference I took from somewhere 😂 lets be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you dont get the credit for them. Lets be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.\ndont trade your authenticity for approval\ntruth is my goal. Controversy is my gym. Ill do a hundred reps of controversy for a 6 pack of truth\nif you wanna see the true character of person watch the way they treat someone who cant do anything for them.\nApril 19th, 2018\ntoday will be the greatest day so far. Life keeps getting better and better.\nwere all servants\nits not where you take things from. Its where you take them to\nthe beauty is in the imperfection\nApril 20th, 2018\nwe need to Aman Giri the world\npeople are celebrating real ideas and vibe. Not just hype\nall you have to be is yourself\nI don’t believe in horizontal hierarchy. If you build a ladder too high it’s actually most dangerous for the people at the top.\nimages are limitless and words arent. Words are defined\nsharing is community holding information is capitalism\niterations of ideas are how culture evolves.\neverything is so planned these days. People appreciate spontaneity and honesty.\nstrive for universal consciousness not segregated consciousness\nstyle is genderless\nYeezy is based in Calabasas but will also be setting up offices in New York London and Wyoming\nthe world is our office\nApril 21st\nI love the way Candace Owens thinks. only free thinkers\nI dont subscribe the term and concept of God fearing. Thats a dated mentality that was used to control people. We are in the future. If God is love and love its the opposite of fear then...🤔🤷‍♂️ to fear God makes no sense 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ live in love not in fear. be fearless. Express what you feel not what youve been programmed to think.\nget past the past\nThe more people contribute to real time global consciousness the faster we evolve\nApril 22nd\nquestion everything\nthe blinders are off\nDemonization has metastasized. The psychological zombie effect. People demonize people and then they demonize anybody who sees anything positive in someone whose been demonized\nwe have freedom of speech but not freedom of thought. The thought police want to suppress freedom of thought.\nConstantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck there\nWe live in a time where people don’t respect people for being themselves. People respect people for following the general trend and consensus. There was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us. But now its a mentality.\nself victimization is a disease\nApril 23\nwere evolving at warp speed\nnew ideas will no longer be condemned by the masses. We are on the frontier of massive change. Starting from breaking out of our mental prisons.\nlife is more exciting than the movies\neven Prince once had an access pass\neveryone should be their own biggest fan\nI’ve always had a desire to do things people wouldn’t even think to do\nIf your foresight is incredible Stay stubborn to your vision\nyou can say anything as long as you put the right emoji next to it.\nApril 24\ndragon 🐉 energy\nNatural born leaders\nVery instinctive\nGreat foresight\nto be great is to be misunderstood\nnever a master. Always a student.\n2024\nspread love\nApril 25\nFree thinkers dont fear retaliation for your thoughts. The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. Youve already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing.\nYou dont have to agree with trump but the mob cant make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I dont agree with everything anyone does. Thats what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.\nIf your friend jumps off the bridge you dont have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I dont tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary\nI love Hillary too.\nI love when people have their own ideas. You dont have to be allowed anymore. Just be. Love who you want to love. Thats free thought. Im not even political. Im not a democrat or a republican\nAnd also Im all the way out the sunken place. And Im not scared anymore. Im not scared of the media. Im not scared of the past and Im optimistic about the future. This tweet is in love not fear.\nwith love I am invincible. Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it.\nI said express love more because we have love but we dont express it. My friend Tmills will always say \"I love you\" and it used to make me feel weird to hear that. Now I tell everyone I love them. He sparked me to start expressing love more.\nWhen my daughter acts out she actually says afterwards I just want to hear you say I love you more.\nno race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love\nfear takes strategy Unlearn linear thinking Hit you with these zig zag thoughts\ndecentralize\nburn that excel spread sheet 🔥😂\nwhenever someone mentions the word \"fan\" to me its super manipulative. Its like \"dont do or say this because of your fans\" My fans are fans of themselves.\nAnd any fan of me wants Ye to be Ye even when they dont agree because I represent the fact that they can be themselves even when people dont agree with them. Drops mic 🎤Yeezy shrug 🤷‍♂️\nApril 26th, 2018\nThough hate is a similar emotion to love. Hate is not the answer. Love is. just think of someone you hate and try saying even to yourself that you love that person.\nThe world is our family\nPeople usually dont agree with people who dont agree with them\nif you feel something dont let peer pressure manipulate you\nthe concept of loving people has a stigma. try telling people you love them it actually feels weird at first. Were really good at hating each other. We have to get good at loving each other.\nYour conscience should allow a physical manifestation of your subconscious but right now most peoples conscious is too affected by other people’s thoughts and it creates a disconnect from you doing what you actually feel now. Instead of doing what you feel you just do what other people think you should do.\nits really cool to say I hate you. But its not cool to say I love you. Love has a stigma\nwe are more worried about what we can lose than what we feel\nspread love. Put more love into the universe.\nArtist transform tragedy into beauty\nApril 27th, 2018\nApril 28th, 2018\nApril 29th, 2018\nApril 30th, 2018\nMay 1, 2018\nMay 2, 2018\nMay 3, 2018\nMay 4, 2018",

"Over the past three decades, people have become dissatisfied with both major parties, and two new minor parties are showing promise of growth and success. They are the Libertarian Party and the Green Party. These are not the only new parties, but they are the only ones that promise to attract people from across the political spectrum. Most other small parties are either clearly to the left of the Democrats or to the right of the Republicans. Such parties would have a place in a system that accommodates multiple parties, but are doomed to failure in a two-party system\nThe Libertarian Party is made up mostly of former conservatives who object to the Republican Partys penchant for militarism and its use of government to entrench powerful interests and shield them from market forces. The Green Party is made up mostly of former liberals who object to the Democratic Partys penchant for centralized bureaucracy and its frequent hypocritical disregard for natural systems of ecological balance, ranging from the human metabolism and the family unit to the ecology of the planet\nBoth minor parties attempt to adhere to guidelines that are much clearer than those of either major party. Libertarians focus on rights of individuals to control their own lives, limited only by the prohibition against interference with the rights of others. These rights include their right to the fruits of their labor and the right to freely associate and form contracts. They advocate limiting government to protecting those basic rights\nGreens advocate ten key values \nThese different guidelines underscore basic differences between the approaches of the two parties and their members. Libertarians tend to be logical and analytical. They are confident that their principles will create an ideal society, even though they have no consensus of what that society would be like. Greens, on the other hand, tend to be more intuitive and imaginative. They have clear images of what kind of society they want, but are fuzzy about the principles on which that society would be based\nIronically, Libertarians tend to be more utopian and uncompromising about their political positions, and are often unable to focus on politically winnable proposals to make the system more consistent with their overall goals. Greens on the other hand, embrace immediate proposals with ease, but are often unable to show how those proposals fit in to their ultimate goals\nThe most difficult differences to reconcile, however, stem from baggage that members of each party have brought with them from their former political affiliations. Most Libertarians are overly hostile to government and cling to the fiction that virtually all private fortunes are legitimately earned. Most Greens are overly hostile to free enterprise and cling to the fiction that harmony and balance can be achieved through increased government intervention\nRepublicans and Democrats will never reconcile these differences, for whatever philosophical underpinnings they have are overwhelmed by vested interests that dominate their internal political processes. These vested interests thrive on keeping the distorted hostilities alive and suppressing any philosophical perspectives that might lead to rational resolution of conflict\nBut because minor parties have no real power, they are still primarily guided by values and principles. Committed to pursuing truth above power, they should be more willing to challenge prejudices and expose flaws in their current positions\nThere is nothing mutually exclusive between the ten key values of the Greens and the principals of the Libertarians. By reconciling these values and principles, we can bring together people whose allegiance to truth is stronger than their biases\nThis could be of great value to both parties, partly because any new party that wants to break into a two-party system has to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters. But even more importantly, each party needs attributes the other has to offer. Libertarians need the intuitive awareness of the Greens to keep them from losing touch with peoples real values, and Greens need the analytical prowess of the Libertarians to keep them from indulging in emotional self-deception. Libertarians can teach Greens about the spirit of enterprise and the wonders of economic freedom, and Greens can teach Libertarians about the spirit of compassion and the wonders of community cohesion\nReconciliation is absolutely necessary. Even if one of the parties could rise to power, it could do great harm by implementing its current agenda in disregard for the perspective of the other. Moreover, proposals that violate values and principles of one party often violate those of the other. If members of both groups come together to discuss each others proposals, they are likely not only to find areas of agreement, but to find conflicts between each groups proposals and its own principals. If this happens, and the two parties work in concert, they stand a real chance of overtaking one of the major parties and drastically altering the political power structure\nMany third parties have had important impacts on American politics, but the last time a political party was dislodged was when the Republicans knocked the ailing Whig party out of contention over 130 years ago. It should be noted that the Republicans were a coalition of several minor parties with seemingly differing agendas, including the Abolitionist Party, the Free-Soil Party, the American Party, disaffected northern Democrats, and most of the members of the dying Whig Party. A similar coalition of parties has a much better chance of repeating this success today\nAnyone who looks at current national platforms of Greens and Libertarians will conclude that bringing these groups together is no easy task. For example, the Libertarian platform states dogmatically that they \"oppose any and all increases in the rate of taxation or categories of taxpayers, including the elimination of deductions, exemptions, or credits in the name of fairness, simplicity, or neutrality to the free market. No tax can ever be fair, simple, or neutral to the free market.\" On the other hand, the national platform of the Greens leaves one with the impression that they never met a tax they didnt like\nYet the historical roots of the Greens and the Libertarians are quite similar. That is, early movements for alternative, intentional communities that live in harmony with nature greatly influenced, and were influenced by, anarcho-syndicalists who advanced principals now embraced by the Libertarian Party. This essay will attempt to show that the differences that have emerged are due less to stated principals and values of either group than to the baggage members have brought to each party from their liberal and conservative backgrounds\nOn Conservatism and Liberalism\nIt is said that Libertarians have a conservative philosophy and Greens have a liberal philosophy. In reality, conservatism and liberalism are mere proclivities, and do not deserve to have the name \"philosophy\" attached to them. People who have more power than others are inclined to conserve it, and people who have less are inclined to liberate it. In Russia, as in feudal England, conservatives wanted more government control, as government was at the root of their power. Liberals wanted more private discretion\nIn the United States today, where power has been vested in private institutions, conservatives want less government and liberals want more. What passes for conservative and liberal \"philosophies\" is merely a set of rationalizations that power-mongers hide behind\nConservative support for traditional approaches and liberal support for new ways of doing things also follows from the desire for power. Traditional approaches have supported those now in power, and change threatens to disrupt that power. Changes are often embraced by conservatives once they prove unable to disrupt the underpinnings of power\nFor Greens and Libertarians to rise above the power-based proclivities of liberalism and conservatism, they must focus on their roots and reconcile their positions with their philosophical underpinnings\nOn the Roots of the Greens\nIn The Green Alternative, a popular book among American Greens, author Brian Tokar states that \"the real origin of the Green movement is the great social and political upheavals that swept the United States and the entire Western world during the 1960s.\" As part of that upheaval, I remember the charge by elders that we acted as though \"we had invented sex.\" Mr. Tokar acts as though we had invented Green values\nActually, all the innovative and vital features of the Greens stem from an earlier Green movement. The influx of disaffected liberals to the movement since the sixties has actually imbued that movement with many features early Greens would find offensive\nThis periodical, for example, has been published more or less regularly since 1943, calling for intentional communities based on holistic living, decentralism, sharing natural bounty, freedom of trade, government by consensus, privately-generated honest monetary systems and a host of other societal reforms. Yet the founder, Ralph Borsodi, wrote extensively about the evils of the state, and would clearly oppose most of the interventionist policies brought to the Green Party by disaffected liberals and socialists. The same can be said of more famous proponents of Green values, such as Emerson and Thoreau\nThe Green movement grew slowly and steadily and quite apart from mainstream liberalism throughout the sixties and seventies. In the eighties, however, it became clear that the liberal ship, and even more clear that the socialist ship, was headed for the political rocks. The left had simply lost credibility, even among those who felt oppressed by the current system. Gradually at first, discouraged leftists discovered the Green movement provided a more credible platform their positions\nBecause of their excellent communications network, additional members of the left quickly discovered the Greens, embraced their values , joined their ranks and proceeded to drastically alter the Green agenda. For example, early Greens pushed for keeping economies more diverse and decentralized by promoting alternative, voluntary systems, and by criticizing lavish government expenditures on interstate highways, international airports, irrigation projects, and centralized bureaucracies that discriminated against small, independent entrepreneurs\nToday the National Platform of the Green Party calls for \"municipalization\" of industry , limits on foreign trade to save American jobs , and other devices to create artificial decentralization under the guiding hand of some benevolent central authority\nThe influence of Greens who are fond of government intervention seems to be strongest at the national level and weakest within most Green local organizations. Despite the National Green Platforms resemblance to a new face on the old left, many people who are genuinely attracted to Green principles are either undermining or abandoning the left-dominated Green Party USA. Specifically, the principal of decentralism is being used to challenge the right of a national committee to dictate positions to local Greens. This is fortunate for those of us interested in a coalition of Greens and Libertarians, as reconciliation between the Green Left and libertarianism is clearly impossible\nOn the Roots of the Libertarianism\nThe Libertarian Party was born in 1971. Like the Green Party, it has philosophical roots that extend far back into history. It emerged, however, at a time when conservatism was in decline. Just as Greens attract liberals today and are strongly influenced by the liberal agenda, Libertarians attracted conservatives and were influenced by their agenda. However, as Libertarians are more analytically rigorous, there are fewer blatant inconsistencies between their positions and their principles\nLibertarian bias tends to show up more in prioritization of issues than in any particular issue. For example, Libertarians are far more prone to complain about the capital gains tax than about many other taxes, even though there is nothing uniquely un-libertarian about that particular tax\nMany Libertarians ignore classic libertarian writings and dwell on the works of Ayn Rand, Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises. The classical libertarians get mere superficial attention. For example, few have read Tragedy of the Commons, but many quote the title. Specifically, they are unwilling to recognize that the ecological mishaps like those referred to in that work had been absent for centuries when almost all land was common. As with the tragedy of the reservations, commons were abused because so many people had to share access to so little land. All this was a result of government sanction, allowing vast tracts of commonly held land to be appropriated by individuals without proper compensation to those who were dispossessed of access to the earth. These facts are ignored because they cannot be reconciled with pseudo-libertarian conservatism\nJust as contemporary Greens have fondness for government and contempt for private property that their forebears did not share, Libertarians take an extreme position on private property and have hostility to all forms of government that their philosophical predecessors did not share\nTheir refusal to acknowledge natural limits to private property and their insistence of unlimited protection of property by the state is their one great departure from their predecessors and their principles. For example, they dismiss the following statement by John Locke, known as the father of private property:\nGod gave the world in common to all mankind. Whenever, in any country, the proprietor ceases to be the improver, political economy has nothing to say in defense of landed property. When the \"sacredness\" of property is talked of, it should be remembered that any such sacredness does not belong in the same degree to landed property\nThey similarly ignore Adam Smiths statement that:\nGround rents are a species of revenue which the owner, in many cases, enjoys without any care or attention of his own. Ground rents are, therefore, perhaps a species of revenue which can best bear to have a peculiar tax imposed upon them\nPrivate ownership of the earth and its resources is the one area where Libertarians depart from their own philosophy. After all, their justification of property is in the right of individuals to the fruits of their labor. Because the earth is not a labor product, land value is not the fruit of its owners labor. Indeed, all land titles are state-granted privileges, and Libertarians deny the right of the state to grant privileges\nEven here, Libertarians are on solid ground when they argue that freedom could not survive in a society where land tenure depended on bureaucratic discretion. They are split, however, over devices like land value taxation that would, with a minimum of bureaucracy, put the landless in a more tenable position with respect to land monopolists. Just as liberals dominate the National Greens, conservatives dominate the Libertarian position on this issue, though many Libertarians, including Karl Hess, former editor of the Libertarian Times, do not share that conservative position\nAgain, this is a key issue for reconciliation. The Green tradition cannot be reconciled with pseudo-libertarian claims that a subset of the people can claim unlimited title to the planet\nThe Magic of Honest Compromise\nCompromise is too often a process whereby people on each side give up what they know to be right in order to gain a supposed advantage for their interest group. What I am proposing is that each side give up supposed advantages in order to harmonize with what is right. It takes an open mind and a great deal of courage, but the results can be magnificent\nIf the Libertarians accept that ownership of land is a privilege, and agree to pay a fair rent for that privilege, they will hold the key to getting rid of property tax, income tax, sales tax, amusement tax, and a host of other taxes. Furthermore, statistical evidence indicates that land value tax promotes compact, harmonious use of land and eliminates a root cause of poverty. In this case, adopting land tax can reduce the need for zoning and protection of rural land, and for housing projects, welfare, and a host of bureaucratic services for the poor\nGreens who study this issue will find that small and simple combination taxes that are essentially payments for exclusive access to common resources will address most of thier interests without complicated and intrusive bureaucracies. Land tax itself will eliminate land speculation and land monopoly, and will promote orderly development of land in cities and towns, taking developmental pressure off suburban and rural land\nSeverence taxes on our common heritage of non-renewable resources can even-handedly reduce the rate of exploitation of these resources, conserving them for future generations\nFinally, taxes on pollution are really payments for exclusive use of our common rights to clean air and water. It reflects that the air and water is less valuable to the rest of us when it is polluted, and those who pollute literally owe us for the right to tresspass on our air and water\nOf course land monopoly will not solve all the problems by itself, but it is the key area where Greens and Libertarians are separated from each other as well as from thier own principles. Once this is reconciled, we can more readily work together on other issues where we are in agreement, such as liberating our monitary system the banking monopoly, ending military domination of foreign peoples, and ending government interference against people who commit victumless \"crimes.\"\nGo to geolibertarian home page",

Well, that ain’t the truth\nI know you, nothing’s what you’ll do\nI’m cut from the granite, and you baby poo\nSofter than some tissue paper – boo hoo\nCry a river, then make sure to fill my swimming pool\nI’m in a different league than all you fools, guess I’m just that dude, shout outs to my attitude\nGood kid, but a little bit rude, I leave it up to you, cuz you’re the one in control of your mood\nMost of y’all are straight hopeless – born to lose\nBut in the end, that’s the path you choose – true\nI ain’t preachin’ that I’m perfect, that’d be absurd, what I’m tryna say is having mind power’s worth it\nOnly got one life, don’t burn it, want something bad enough, then go earn it\nReally hoping this burns like a furnace, you gotta wake up at some point to flourish\nIf you’re down in the dumps, find somethin’ to cure it, time to get that ass to work bitch!\nHOOK x",

"Kanye West has been married for ten days, and he has that new-husband way with the ring still, pulling it on and off like its something he might yet undo, or do again. The ring is gold, and understated in a way that not much else about Kanye West is. He sits in the lobby of New Yorks Mercer Hotel—the same hotel where he and Jay Z recorded most of Watch the Throne—reflecting on the distance hes come. \"I am a black American male from Chicago,\" West says, \"who had my rehearsal dinner at Versailles and then got married in Florence with a view of the entire city.\"\nHe is one year removed from Yeezus, the record that took all of Wests prodigious pop gifts and made a show of immolating them one by one. He is one year removed from telling anyone whod listen that he was going to burn the entire fashion industry down, or at least he would once they let him through the door. Now they kind of have: Hes got a capsule collection with A.P.C. out now; a line with Adidas that debuts with footwear this fall; and somewhere off in the distance, a new menswear line. Hes also got a new record—maybe even a full-on pop record, though he hasnt decided yet. He knows he is no longer the most popular man in rap. \"Currently that spot is taken,\" West says. \"Lets be honest—he got last summer.\"\nWho?\n\"You know. Theres only one person.\"\nDrake?\n\"Yeah. He got last summer. And Id never given it up till last summer.\" Now hes thinking about taking it back. \"Its a real question for me. Do I want to?\"\nMeanwhile, hes reckoning with what it is to be a father and a husband and a decent human. Hes happier now—\"You see I havent name-dropped and said a bunch of negative stuff about people,\" he says at one point—but no less homicidally competitive or less convinced that hes the next Steve Jobs. Hed like to spend more time with his family. Hed also still like to build amusement parks. Its a contradiction, one hes only begun to resolve. And all the while, he cant go outside with his wife, Kim Kardashian, without having his photo taken. His entire waking life has become a performance, a manifesto, a fashion shoot\nMost of the time, hes cool with that fact. But not always. \"I hope we dont see no paparazzi today,\" West says. \"Because Im still getting acquainted with these jogging pants I threw on. Like, Thats not my statement!\t\"\nYou got married a week ago. Youre the lead subject in practically every tabloid on the planet right now. Are you comfortable in that position, having that many eyes on you?\nThat wasnt my goal. My goal is just to be respected as a man when I walk down the street with my family. I dont care what your job is, youre not gonna talk down to me, youre not gonna try to get a rise out of me. Im a man first. And in establishing that, some interesting things have happened. \nLike that TMZ video from last year, where youre walking with your pregnant fiancée with your head down to avoid the paparazzi, to the point where you walked into a sign and hit your head. Then TMZ made fun of you for walking into the sign. How do you live like that?\nIts difficult. And then put on top of that the idea of going and taking meetings with people, and people say, \"We dont want to work with you, because we saw you get mad about running into the sign.\"\nDoes that kind of mockery feel like an effort to de-fang you?\nBut also, theres no fangs. I dont have fangs. Im a porcupine. Im a blowfish. Like, Im a—whats the fish that blows up?\nA blowfish?\nYeah. Im a blowfish. Im not a shark, Im a blowfish. So that perfect example about me hitting my head, its like a blowfish. I wasnt coming out of my house going to a paparazzis house to attack them. Im defending my family in front of my own house. Im defending my name as someones screaming something negative at me. Thats a blowfish. People have me pinned as a shark or a predator in some way, and in no way am I that. I wouldnt want to hurt anyone. I want to defend people. I want to help people\nCan I read you something? The New York Posts Page Six has an account of your wedding that reads, in part: \"Kanye returned one hour before the wedding and didnt like the all-white bar that was in front of the Gold Toilet Tower. He took a saw and started sawing it in half himself. Two men held the bar stable as he sawed, and sawed, into the bar, defacing the entire front, screaming at everyone around him. He said it looked like a bar from Texas. Then he ordered two pieces of raw wood to be nailed onto the front of the bar. Once the wood was in place, Now, he said, its art. The Italian construction teams looked at this guy and couldnt believe what they were seeing.\"\nFor the person that wrote that, were they involved with anything last year that was as culturally significant as the Yeezus tour or that album? They didnt even talk there about the photographs, or the dress, or Andrea Bocelli singing, or the marble tables. Theyre like: \"Its a gold toilet.\" No. The bathrooms—that usually would be a porta-potty—were wrapped in a fabric that was neutral to match the fort. The bar was terrible, and the wedding planner didnt approve it with me. I was having issues with this wedding planner the entire time on approvals, and I get there and they threw some weird plastic bar there. So the same materials that were used to cover the bathroom, we said, \"Lets just use that, because this is all we have to make the bar look better.\" Which it did, in the end. And anyone knows that you cannot pick up tools yourself, because of—what are those rules about the workers?\nUnions?\nYeah, unions. You cant do that. Its illegal. Thats false\nThen they say you gave a forty-five-minute toast to yourself\nAnd what I talked about in it was the idea of celebrity, and celebrities being treated like blacks were in the 60s, having no rights, and the fact that people can slander your name. I said that in the toast. And I had to say this in a position where I, from the art world, am marrying Kim. And how were going to fight to raise the respect level for celebrities so that my daughter can live a more normal life. She didnt choose to be a celebrity. But she is. So Im going to fight to make sure she has a better life\nHow does it feel when you read something like that account of your wedding or you see a photo of you looking glum at a zipline go viral?\nMy feelings dont matter anymore\nOf course they do\nNo. One of the things that I said at the speech was, anyone thats at this table has had to defend me or Kim or both of us at some point in their life. Ask a boxer: \"In the third round, when he hit you from the side on your ear, how did that specifically feel?\" You wouldnt ask a boxer that. Because you know theyre there to fight. Meaning now you know Im here to fight. Im here to fight for the re-education of what celebrity is. To say, \"Yes, we are celebrities, but yes, were also innovators, were also inventors, were also thoughtful.\"\nBut thats sad to me. You should be able to be a human with feelings, too\nThats fine. But thats not the case, is it?\nIs that the way you feel, that youre always in the ring?\nYeah. Im sitting right here, its a fight. Im fighting with the way I line my words up together and the way I place a sweater on top of a T-shirt. At this point, people know whats up. People know Im smart. And people know that, whether its SNL or Jimmy Kimmel, its a trend to take the piss out of celebrity—just as much of a trend as wearing a gray hoodie or driving a Prius\nBut you voluntarily married into a celebrity family, right? In 2014, there are no bigger tabloid stars than Kim Kardashian\nIn the speech, I talked about the idea of collaboration and all the people involved working together and being able to change things. Meaning there was a time for two or three years where fashion designers wouldnt give Kim dresses. There was a time they wouldnt even let me be at shows. Now the idea that Kim is in a Givenchy Couture dress is raising the communication. Because people would be more apt to be like, \"Celebrities dont really have style. Celebrities cant dress. Celebrities are less educated.\" But they havent had the chance to be able to break through and have Carine Roitfeld sitting right there. Carine Roitfeld is the Walt Disney of what Tumblr is today. She is the Kanye West of what Tumblr is today. Shes the single most important person to what street style is today. And she was at the wedding seven seats down from Kim, who is one of the number one fashion plates of today. So I said, \"Wow, Carine is seven seats down from Kim. Farnaz , the producer of the Kardashians and the producer of The Real World, is four seats down from Steve McQueen. And four seats, because in between them is Hosain from Jawbone.\" This is what I talked about. That was not a forty-five-minute speech to myself. Do you realize what that means for those people to be in that close of a proximity to each other?\nBut if you read a lot of the tabloid coverage, the implication is: Kim and her family are bringing you down. Jay Z and Beyoncé didnt show up at your wedding because of them. That kind of thing\nAll that, I wouldnt even speak on. It doesnt even matter to me whatsoever, who would show up. Because the most important person to show up there, to me, was Kim. And thats all that matters to me. I had to fight for that for seven years. But the fact that these other people showed up that are from such different worlds but have done such dynamic things—theyre all, in a way, equal to what Kim has done in TV or what I had done in music. I was so moved that I just wanted people to stop and think they werent sitting at a table full of fashion people, they werent sitting at a table full of celebrities, they werent sitting at a table full of movie directors. It really was a representation of the way we receive information today, post-Internet. And so Page Six cant overshadow the main point: Carine Roitfeld was sitting next to Kim Kardashian. That alone to me is like the same moment when I brought Mos Def to the studio with Jay Z. Its about the people, and the fact that theyre from different walks of life, and that theyre working together and not discriminating against each other. There was a class system, and now theres a creative class system, and I think thats what you were talking about a bit—the class system of creativity\nAnd my point was, they leave Kim out of it\nAnd my point is, they were all at her wedding\nA skeptic would say thats because of you\nBut when an Instagram photo gets 2.3 million likes—\nYour wedding photo, which is currently the most liked photo on Instagram ever.\nThats because of who?\nI dont know\nDont say you dont know! Its because of Kim. Meaning theres no photo that I would have put up by myself, or next to one of my smarty friends, that would have got that amount of likes. So now you take this photo that has that amount of likes, and it has a flower wall from the same guy who does the Lanvin shows, and it has a couture Givenchy dress and Givenchy tuxedo in it. Thats the point. Now the thing that is the most popular is also communicating the highest level of creativity. The concept of Kimye has more cultural significance than what Page Six could write\nWhyd you decide to get married?\nSaying \"Hey, I like Kim\" isnt as inspiring to people as us getting married. And anyone thats in a relationship knows that in order to get to the point to get married and then to be married and to then carry on, it needs that work put into it. Right now, people look at it and its like, \"Wow, thats inspiring.\" Meaning that love is infectious. You know, God is infectious—God flowing through us and us being little-baby creators and shit. But His energy and His love and what He wants us to have as people and the way He wants us to love each other, that is infectious. Like they said in Step Brothers: Never lose your dinosaur. This is the ultimate example of a person never losing his dinosaur. Meaning that even as I grew in cultural awareness and respect and was put higher in the class system in some way for being this musician, I never lost my dinosaur\nKim is this girl who fucking turns me on. I love her. This is who I want to be next to and be around. And then people would try to say, \"Well, you know, if youre a musician, you should be with a musician, and if you want to design, you need to be with a girl from the design world.\" I dont give a fuck about peoples opinions. Because when a kid falls in love with an airplane or a bike or a dinosaur—especially if youre an only child and its not because of the book that the sibling was reading—its like, fuck, you mean to tell me that the dinosaurs walked the earth and stuff like that?! Thats amazing! You mean to tell me that these giant multi-ton crafts can fly that fast and that loud, and they can flip, and theres danger, the possibility of them exploding? Thats fucking cool! You mean to tell me that this girl with this fucking body and this face is also into style, and shes a nice person, and she has her own money and is family-oriented? Thats just as cool as a fucking fighter jet or dinosaur! And just as rarely seen\nThats a lovely way of putting it\nI feel like youre stronger as a team. Because when you know you have a team player, its not one on the world anymore. At least its two on the world\nTwo and a half, if you want to count your daughter\nYeah, and then two and a half, eventually. Its like having some eyes in the back of your head. Thats one reason why, when people try to spoof or talk shit, its like: But youre mad because basically Kim is the type of girl that, her entire life, if you were in school with her, most people would be studying and up late nights, but for some reason she would have the skill set to go and grab the one book, turn to the exact page, and just magically say, \"Thats the exact answer.\" Or she could wink at the person who had done all the work and get it done anyway. And the point of life is getting shit done and being happy\nAre you the father you hoped youd be? Theres that song on Watch the Throne, \"New Day,\" where you and Jay Z talk about your unborn children, and you basically say: \"I want my kid to be completely the polar opposite of me.\"\nAnd the joke was that I was supposed to say on the song, \"Come on, Jay, you know were both gonna have daughters.\" And Im so mad, because you know when I pop that creative-genius shit? If I had had that, that couldve been my one moment where Im like: \"Okay, fuck all the conversation. Look at that. I called that one.\"\nHow do you feel about Yeezus now, a year later?\nI think Yeezus is the beginning of a completely new era of music. It was all new rules. It just broke every rule possible. None of the ideas were popular ideas. Even \"Bound 2,\" when the video came out, I think peoples apprehension—I mean, its the same as any other Kanye West video. You just have colorful bears running around. It was completely morphed and weird and psychedelic and really druggy. I would have just liked to have had more nudity in it. Thats the only thing. I just want to do crazy, colorful shit like that that has more nudity\nWhat about \"New Slaves\"? Do you think people would react differently to that song if it came out now?\nIts funny, because when the Clippers situation happened, people started bringing up that song again. Sometimes you do things in the same way that a designer might throw out a new cut or a rapper might throw out a new concept, and people might not be into it at that time. If \"New Slaves\" had come out right after the Clippers incident, it would have seemed more timely. So the thirty meetings that I was having where I was going through a lot of these \"Stay in your place\" type conversations—\"Stay in your box, this is what you do, you cant do anything else\"—that led me to the point of creating \"New Slaves\" and \"Blood on the Leaves\" and the entire Yeezus album, and to make the album basically like a protest in music, where it only has like four melodies on it—you know, other people werent in that place. Obviously certain things are more digestible for mass consumption. But it was interesting. That song that I do feel is the best rap verse of all\nTime—\nWhich song?\n\"New Slaves.\" The second verse. I argue that its the best rap verse of all time. Its the Coming to America or Anchorman of a verse. You know, its got the funny shit. Its got the antagonization. Its got patterns. Its got social and political consciousness. Its got struggle. Its got bravado. Its everything that a rap verse is supposed to be\nWere you mad when Rick Rubin came out and said that you did half the vocals on Yeezus in two hours before hopping on a plane?\nYeah! Because yeah, I rapped them. But I worked on them for like eight months! And the thing is, I had to finish the verses in order for the album to come out, and its game time. I didnt freestyle those verses. That shit was worked and processed and Disneyfied and everything. By the way, those lines are super scary and serious, and everything that Im saying on Yeezus is super politically direct, so I think that its funny that you said that, because I think he needs to clarify that to people—that I didnt make it up in that time. I just said them in that time\nWhen you said what you said last year about the fashion industry and your frustration with it, did your phone ring after that?\nIt did move the needle. Only positive came from it. Maybe Im not as good friends as I could have been with the Saint Laurent designer. And now I dont get the red-and-black versions of the white-and-black pants that are in stores, or whatever I would have got as a musician. But other than that, that communication was real. Alexander Wang made sure that I was able to go to a Balenciaga show, and I was never allowed to do that before because I was a celebrity. Listen to what Im saying—me, as Kanye West: I guarantee you, Im more than 50 percent responsible for every mens shoe that they sell. Me, the singular person. More than 50 percent responsible for every Balenciaga shoe they sell. And they would say, \"You cant come to the show, because you are a celebrity.\" But all honesty, no ego, I have a level of influence, and I have a level of respect for the designers. And we move product on that Barneys floor\nTheres an analogy to music, right? You provided the sales template there, too. You cant listen to rap now without hearing music that sounds like your old music, right?\nIt sounds exactly like that\nWhat does that mean in terms of putting the new record together? Do you want the pendulum to swing back and do something more pop, like Twisted Fantasy or Graduation?\nI think just my usual pattern is like that. Its like a pendulum. The pendulum gains momentum by swinging in the other direction. Even lyrically, I think about certain lines that I say on my new single, which is called \"All Day,\" that usually Jay would say, but Jays not on there. So I say, All day, nigga, its Ye, nigga. Shopping for the winter, its just May, nigga. Ball so hard, man, this shit cray, nigga. You aint getting money unless you got eight figures. Right? Jay would have said that. And then eventually I would have came in with, like, whatever I come in with. But the balance of a meal is that when people walk in, they want water first. People definitely werent getting water first on Yeezus. I do fight with myself to say, \"Keep fighting.\" But also, you know, you cant win every single fight. Its a long war, and if youre out there trying to, like, blow up every single building, you wont win the war\nYeezus seemed to be a moment when you maybe let go of wanting a Grammy. You let go of wanting record sales, in a way that seemed uncharacteristic for you\nWhen I was sitting and trying to do a collaboration with the Gap, in the meeting, when theyre like, \"No, because youre a celebrity, and you have a bad reputation, and you dont know anything about clothing, so we dont want to do this\"—in that meeting, theres no extra single that I could have done that could have got me that deal. Theres no extra Grammy that I could have won that could have made it more real. And thats the reason why I had to express the way I feel. Which all rhymed just right there. But Yeezus was extremely purposeful. And what came from Yeezus: Paparazzi are nicer to me. The entire fashion industry is nicer to me. I do have a collaboration coming out. Young designers that would go and work at a house now look and say, \"Wow, maybe we could potentially work at Donda. Maybe we could work for Kanye. Maybe thats a real thing.\" Because designers that are geared up to only want to work at a French fashion house are completely under the perception that it wouldnt be cool to work for a celebrity\nBut its such a delicate dance, right? At a certain point, maybe you have to go back and you have to sell some records, win some awards, to maintain your spot in music\nMan, its crazy. And having to take all of your energy, or a lot more of your energy, to focus on fashion. And while youre focusing on that, such-and-such just keeps coming for the spot\nAnd I might complain about how hard it is in clothing, but also I think its great that its so hard. Because the barrier to entry is really, really, really, really high. And Im literally trying to do—back when I did Watch the Throne, and the fashion, I think it was just too much for people. It was just too crazy. It was just too crazy to do Watch the Throne, \"Niggas in Paris,\" shoot a surround-vision film in Qatar, show the film in Cannes…\nPut a kilt on\nYeah, kilt. Then do two fashion shows with Jourdan Dunn, Joan Smalls, Irina Shayk, have Diddy, Anna Wintour, Riccardo, Kim at the show, and drop the Yeezys? It felt like every single industry that I was trying to tap into looked at every other industry and everyone held hands. It was like, \"Fuck that. No. This is just too crazy.\"\nSo whats the lesson you take away from that?\nHistorys gonna be harder to make than I thought\nIn 2010 you put out My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, released a new record every Friday, you were on Twitter all the time, you were still blogging at that point… You lived a whole year in public\nYeah\nBut you fell back from that\nBoth me and Kim had to learn how to communicate as a team. These are two LeBrons, you know? Meaning she could do shit that a girlfriend in a relationship could never do. Obviously. And I could do stuff that a guy in a relationship could never do. So if you look at half my tweets back then, they were always, like, funny tweets that I wouldnt be able to say now. It wouldnt be respectful to my relationship. Its interesting, as Im delving into being married: Like, what is my verbal creative communication? Thats another thing I really like about clothing and film—you could still communicate with a film, because its not you. But when youre a reality star or a rapper, you are the film\nThats been true for you, right? The year 2010 was really just a different kind of movie\nYeah. It was more Wolf of Wall Street.\nYouve said that one of the reasons you did Watch the Throne was that you wanted to learn to communicate in the easy way that Jay Z communicated. Do you feel like that experience helped you at all?\nYes! Its picking up skill sets that give you longevity. Thats what I like about Jay. He has longevity. Hes still at the top of relevancy from the way he moves, the way he interacts with people, his ability to brush things off of his shoulder and just win at life. Hes the poster child of winning. And I think I was the poster child of, like, fighting and winning. But you always saw the fight. And with Jay, you always saw the win\nAnother gifted communicator in your life is Kim. Have you learned from her?\nThats funny that youre saying that. One of the reasons why I think that me and Kim are very powerful together isnt just the concept of celebrity or this mega rap star and this mega-beautiful pop star. Its something I explain to my girl: She is who she is. I am who I am. We have advisers and friends and everything, but those people are who they are and we are who we are. And what I had to learn from Kim is how to take more of her advice and less of other peoples advice. Theres a lot of Kim K skills that were added. In order to win at life, you need some Kim K skills, period\nHow close are you, fashion-line-wise? A year away? Five years away?\nIt depends. I think the people that are in the positions of power are starting to see or recognize that its more than a celebrity thing, its more than a music thing, and that there is something there. Theres people who do celebrity lines. Its what they do. Theyve signed up to sit at a different table and to be in a different business than the people who do high-end lines\nIts the difference, presumably, between what youre doing for Adidas and what Pharrell or 2 Chainz are doing for Adidas\nYeah. And you havent even seen what Im doing for Adidas!\nRight. But—\nYou just know\nWhat about the new record? How far away is that?\nI dont know, man. I hope I can get one of these songs out in the next couple of weeks, just to have something up and running. But I think most likely September. I go back and forth. Like, should it be September or should it be October? Should it be November? When Beyoncé was working on her last album, she took a while. I was thinking it could somehow come out in June, like Yeezus, and just kill it for the summer. But then Im like, I have to work on Adidas and be with my child\nBut you have a lot of the first single already?\nYeah. This time three years ago, here at the Mercer, working on \"Niggas in Paris,\" at this time in early June, it was apparent it was still not finished. I had the \"married at the mall\" line, we had \"that shit cray,\" Jay had his verse… Jay finished his verse. He always finishes, and my shit is always kind of open. Like, \"Okay, now Ive got the Will Ferrell sample, so I need to say something that finishes the verse. But people have to not know what it means.\" So its like problem-solving to get to the point where youre saying, \"going gorillas.\" Its difficult sometimes\nBut now, for the new album, one new thing could change everything. I had an idea of the way I wanted to do the album. And then I got a new song thats so good that the album has to be balanced against it. This song is a song that can be in the club like \"Dont Like\" or \"Niggas in Paris.\" Whereas before I was working on the album and I had these beautiful songs, they were just more songs. They werent saying, \"Okay, tuck your whole summer in.\" They were just saying, \"Hey, Im a great musician, I make these beautiful songs, and they have all this meaning, and nobody can make anything that means this much.\"\nI feel like people have no idea if youre ever actually happy, or what makes you happy\nWell, when I work on an album, its fun at certain times. Theres some accomplishments, and sometimes theres a bit of frustration. And its usually like a nine-month process, right? This is a multi-lifetime process that we have now embarked on. Meaning starting now, youre just starting to see a glimmer of what the idea of West will mean. So right now, at this age and with this visibility and with the skill sets that Kim is now giving me, I think I have a good chance of success in building something that has longevity, high integrity, high success rate, and is very fulfilling, not only for me creatively but also in adding fulfillment to peoples lives. Adding ease. Adding wonder. Adding magic\nBut does happiness arrive at the end of that rainbow? I think people genuinely wonder that\nWell, you build your happy wife, happy life, happy home, all this stuff, right? Everybody thats in a relationship that has ever worked on a home knows one of the most frustrating processes is actually working on the home. So when people would see me last year, two years ago, unhappy, I was in the process of building the home\nBut what makes me happy is land, and were on a boat now. This is Christopher Columbus. This is uncharted waters were on. Wed be super happy to be on land, and also a little bit like, \"Ah, the journeys over!\" But I feel like, we got the Vogue cover, Steve McQueen won the Oscar, we finally got married… You know? We have a child. Were a family now. I am an arbiter of taste, and people think that I have the ability to make things cool—or if Im doing it, it should be cool. And I feel that this stuffs starting to be cool. And that feels good to me. Because I dont like walking around with people thinking Im doing uncool shit, because theres nothing Im doing thats uncool. Its all innovative. You just might not understand it yet. But its cool. Family is super cool. Going home to one girl every night is super cool. Just going home and getting on the floor and playing with your child is super cool. Not wearing a red leather jacket, and just looking like a dad and shit, is like super cool. Having someone that I can call Mom again. That shit is super cool",

"Last time I got here, before I even arrived, they had ‘fuck Kanye’ on the motherfuckin’ port-a-potties. But this year, we gon’ piss on ‘em, on they motherfuckin’ port-a-potties.\nHow many of yall dont give a fuck about what the press say? Its 2014. College Dropout came out 2004. I want yall to know, every time I go to the studio, every time I do an interview, every time I make a motherfuckin t-shirt, the thing I do, I give it everything I got. And when I talk that shit, its so that you can talk that shit. If you a fan of me, you a fan of your motherfuckin self. You can do something thatll change the world. Look at how they try to make me look. They try to make me look crazy. And the people that write that? I dont see them performing for 90,000 motherfuckers … I know you seen movies and shit. Jimi Hendrix. John Lennon. Jim Morrison. I know yall seen movies and shit. But yall livin a movie right motherfucking now. Because I AM THE NUMBER ONE MOTHERFUCKING ROCK STAR ON THE PLANET.\nYou know, I had a meeting with Oprah Winfrey. She wanted to give me some advice. What she told me was that the corporations are scared of me. Im like, Little ol me?! Why you scared of me?! Because I tell the kids the truth?! Why yall scared of me?! Why they so scared of me? … Little ol me? Because I want peoples minds to finally be free. Whats the new cool? Whats the new cool? Can you tell me whats the new cool? Because I want to hide behind that. I need some new barricade to hide behind. I need a new cool. Whats the new shit out? Whats the new shit out with the most commercials at the Super Bowl? Lets just stop the music and play a Bruno Mars song right now, how about that? They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl. They told me I could never play at the Super Bowl. Not until Im super old. Not until Im super old … They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl. They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl, at least not until Im super old. So I think its time—hold up, f—k that toast.\nBut I promise yall tonight, as I stand here, 37-years-old, this is only the beginning. This is only the beginning … Because in all honesty, Im not gonna lie to yall right now, this might not come off as humble, but Im gonna tell yall the truth. I aint concerned about nobody thats actually living. I know people get mad at me when I compare myself, but thats the only way I can explain what my aspirations are. When Im talkin bout Walt Disney, when Im talkin bout Howard Hughes, when Im talkin bout Henry Ford, when Im talkin bout Beethoven, when I talk about Mozart, when I talk about Shakespeare, and they all had their time on this earth. And Im only 37. And right now Im rockin to 90,000, of yall motherfuckers right now. So I aint goin at anybody on the radio. Im goin after Shakespeare. Im goin after Walt Disney. Im going after Howard Hughes. Im going after David Stern. Im goin after Henry Ford. Im going after Elon Musk. Okay, he is living, but hes my boy. Whether you believe it or not … you can only achieve as high as you believe. You can only achieve as high as you believe … And just like Martin had a dream, and just like Kendrick had a dream. I believe in everything. I believe in anything. You can only believe … I can only stand here when I been fucked up so many times. Fucked up so many times … And I know that I aint perfect. But everything Im not makes me everything I am.\nI came to Bonnaroo six months after my mom passed. Pearl Jam went on three hours long. I did the Glow In The Dark show here. My shit was going on when the motherfuckin daylight was comin on. They said I was runnin late. They blared my motherfuckin tanks, my cryo, my pyro, they wrote FUCK KANYE on that shit. Yall wrote that shit in the press. WHERE THE PRESS AT? Yall gonna write all these motherfuckers puttin they hands up right now? WHERE THE PRESS AT? WHERE THE PRESS AT? WHERE THE PRESS AT? Man, Ill run that shit. This is real rock n roll. If you ever grew up on real music, the reason why you write that shit about music? Im from the South Side of Chicago. I dreamed of R. Kelly giving me a deal.\nSomebody told me that everybody on the plane was coming out here to Bonnaroo, to come check me out, and you know, it humbled me. It humbled me, and at the same time gave me confidence. It gave me a quiet confidence, a steel confidence, a feeling that it was actually gonna happen, a feeling that it was Gods plan. Gods plan. Gods plan, something I could never understand, understand, understand, its all in Gods plan. Gods plan. Gods plan. Gods plan … So whether you believe it or not … the fact that there are so many people here tonight, it humbles me. It humbles me—but not in the Websters definition of humility. It humbles me in a way that gives me strength, to know that its in Gods plan. And I know I set my goals very high.",

"Ye, how are you my brother?\nIm good\nYes sir, I seen a lot of pictures of you lately out and about you know. So my first question is how are you?\nIm feeling good\nThe last time I think people heard about you in the news was Kanye West was having a mental breakdown so mentally where are you?\nI think Im in a stronger place then I have a that I was after the breakdown I like to say breakthrough\nWhat do you what do you think caused the mental breakdown?\nFear, stress, control, being controlled manipulation like being a pawn and a chess piece of life stressing things that that create like validation that I didnt need to worry about as much and you know that just this the concept of competition and being in competition with so many you know elements at one time on a race against time your age all yo youre getting o race against popularity on the radio Callie got the songs rate got this song on radius playing to dev st. Pablo aint playing I could do that man take the whole I could take the whole interview\nIm talking about yeah you never you youve been the guy that has always created a flow not gone with the flow. So it seems like you were a little upset that you werent a part of the flow?\nIt was weird. I was looking at, you know, were doing Saint Pablo and the cultural impact is incredible, but Im looking for other forms of validation, when theres other frequencies and other currencies.\nSo just because its not playing on the radio, of course we had you know \"Father Stretches\" in the club and and on the radio a bit, like it went to number one but you know, to put that same amount, if not more work, into a piece of work and then you used to it coming out like Graduation where everything is everywhere...you know its frustrating. And really, ever since the Taylor Swift moment it just had never, had never been the same; the connection with radio. Its liken whatever powers that be it was much harder after that. Then also you know LA leaving Universal like, you know he had that radio locked.\nSo if you an artist and you signed to a major label, you want to be on the radio, specially if you if you popular, if you poppin, you know if you one of the most famous people on the planet and people love your music and all the best artists in the world are coming to your concert and all friends is like, you know Snapchatting themselves at the shows and you selling merch out like that...it seems like \"Okay radio should just be intact\". It mightve been just a piece of information that I was missing, that wasnt being expressed to me, that I didnt understand because at the end of day someones controlling it and I didnt understand it.\nBut the radio element was just one of the factors. Theres like, you know, the situation with my wife in Paris and all of the elements of like you feeling like, you know, helpless. You feeling like what can you? Do a thousand...I went to Paris on that trip to protect her, but not protect her you know physically but to go and just help her with her looks, because shes in Paris. So Im like let me put my eye on it personally while shes out in Paris and make sure she busts these niggas ass. Just get fly.\nAnd one of the things that she said that she heard is that they were coming to rob her and they had to wait until I had left and when I finally, and that the people, would have been strategizing and scheming on that for a long time. So when she probably got to Paris by herself, theyre like, \"Okay this is our chance\". Next thing you know I get off on the flight the next day and they were like, \"Oh okay, we gotta like fall back\". And then you know, when I left a couple days later, Im on stage and I hear that, my boy Sky comes up to me and says, \"You know, your wife was robbed\". And I at that point, I didnt know the whole element, or the whole story of what was happening.\nPrevious to that you know, just one week before that or two weeks before that I had done a fashion show. And I was 45 minutes late. And they LeBronned me bro! Like, remember like when LeBron went to Miami? They just killed him and burned his Jersey and all that. Its like, I had just done MSG! Young Thug on stage, you know and then go and plug in your iPhone with 16,000 people, everybody in the audience, whoever you want to name and shit you, know streaming live, all this like a breakthrough.\nSoon as I was 45 minutes late, I felt it was the fashion community getting the right to say \"nigger\" without saying it. To be like, \"Yo we know you come through stepping on necks and all that and what you doing when you approaches things and stuff. But if you get out of line boy? Were gonna roast you\".\nAnd it affected me because Im an artist, and it affected me like emotionally. Its like all these things were like almost set up to put me on meds. To break me down. The robbery, like I dont you know, I dont know where that you know where that came from. You know, was that a bigger plan a bigger set up? You know also just being on stage four times a night, I mean four times a week you know you get exhausted up there.\nSo you were mentally exhausted, emotionally exhausted physically exhausted, everything\nyeah, fine yeah\nDid you go to therapy at all? Cuz I feel like this is a lot to unpack. And Im sure youre the go-to guy for a lot of people so its like who does the go-to guy go to? So Im sure you had to go to some therapist or something.\nNah, I use the world as my therapist. Anyone I talk to is my therapist. I will pull them into the conversation of what Im feeling at that point and get their perspective. Sometimes theyd be like \"Damn Im talkin to Ye, Im not expecting to talk about this user you know Ill\ntalk through things anybody that I\nMariah and I put that as advice to\npeople its like use people around you\nas your therapist because they probably\nknow more about you like therapist is\nlike does a crash course in yeh and then\ncomes its like I want to give you you\nknow some advice and Im not saying that\nthe therapists are bad Im just saying\nthat I like to just talk into\nacquaintance friends family and you know\nminutes at a time talking through things\nits like its kind of narcissistic you\nknow talk about my problems using the\nenergy even like just then being a\nsounding board and talking through it so\nyou know I guess mental health so to\nspeak you seem to be in a good space\nmentally so how did how did you get\nthere you just talk to it with people or\nwas it music see returning to Twitter\nnow just getting these thoughts out\ntherapeutically yeah but Im not even\nthe thoughts that Im getting out on\nTwitter right now and that you know I\nthink everything is therapeutic but Im\nnot doing it as a you know a form of a\npersonal therapy its just an innate\nfeeling I just I want to express I\ndecided to use this platform to express\nsome breakthroughs that Ive had since\ngoing to the hospital what if some of\nthose breakthroughs you know you said\nsomething about the fashion world I mean\nminutes late they tried to cut your head\noff its kind of the same thing with\nTaylor Swift when you got onstage and\nyou know interrupted acceptance its\nlike do you feel like whenever youre in\nspaces where youre tolerated as opposed\nto celebrate it they let they remind you\nof that oh yeah you get reminded all the\ntime but uh the reminders dont mean\nnothing to me anymore\nIve broken it you know this is this is\na Hermes level existence at this point\nyou know like you look at a Birkin bag\nthe way its made the more scratches on\nit the more the more value it has you\nknow so all those things those pieces of\nthe story have created Who I am today\nand I wouldnt turn down anything like I\nalways would be thinking about you as I\nwas recovering and always thought ima\ngo and talk to Charlemagne first and I\njust wanted to say like there was\nelements about going to the hospital and\nhaving a breakdown or a breakthrough\nthat was fire it was incredible the\nfeeling wasnt quick you know well on\nthe song st. Pablo I said Im praying an\nout-of-body experience that happened so\npeople could see my light and know its\nnot just rapid you had the context of\nrap here go here go one related I want\nto talk about rap pickle one related to\nour saying about the fashion show so if\nmy name pops up in a publication and you\nknow today I dont want to use white\nblack the black man show all too much\nabout I want to modernize but I want to\nspeak about the concept of racism is\nsomething that is something were in is\nsomething of the past is something will\nbreak in the future so I say this you\nknow if its a white publication if they\nuse the word rapper they not saying that\nin a complimentary way they trying to\nsay that to not classify it in a Howard\nHughes Picassos you know Im just an\nartist way yeah artists or just person\nor something just who I am what I say\nsay my name and whatever just say my\nfirst name or say half of my first thing\njust say yeah whatever and whatever\nsomeone takes from that\nthen cool and then say what happened I\njust leave it there\ndont put no extra sauce on it so when\nthey put the wrapper and then theyll\nsay something Ill say thats like\nabsolutely inspired but if they put it\nin the something inspired in the wrong\ncontext will come off as I dont want to\nsay crazy because I also want to change\nthe stigma of crazy and I want to change\nthe stigma of mental health period and I\nhave not done no extra study on it\nwe at the beginning of it at the\nbeginning a conversation but best\nbelieve Im gonna take stigma off the\nword crazy but lets just say for now\npeople would take something thats\nenlightened put it in different contexts\nand then call it crazy to try to\ndiminish the impact and the value of\nwhat Im actually saying every Friday at\nlike Rafiki and The Lion King remember I\nthink he knew exactly what simply came\nfrom you knew exactly whose symbol was\nor what symbol was about but everybody\nwould say all right freaky is crazy he\nstay away from him and when they roughly\nhe took that staff and hits them\noverhead and said no youre crazy\nbecause you dont even know who you are\nlook at this Lake and let me show you\nwhere you come from I think you might\nhave forgotten that your kanye was yeah\ncuz so many people was trying to read\ntrying to make you believe that you were\nlesser than who you truly are\noh yeah if you hang around people who\nact like you are who you are then youll\nforget who you are and I got a doper\nwait Ive read Ive written it down and\nI was walked over with yeah yeah tweet\nyou know we should just tweet tweet that\nright now shit speaking of Twitter yeah\nyou know how does that feel coming back\nto quit because I would say coming back\nto Twitter because I would think that\nthe hardest thing for Kanye wasnt to be\nquiet\nyeah he was quiet for like a year I\ndidnt have a lot to say I had a lot to\nlearn and you know right now your\ndocument where Im at this is I felt the\nneed to speak at this point you know\nwhen you when you look up at five years\nfrom now\nor ten years from now theyll be Ill be\neven more I have more experience Ill be\nin a Ill be in a better place than I\nwas today\nbut its good for you to see yeah you\nknow therell be mistakes therell be\nflaws and the way I communicate today\nbecause were human beings were flawed\nIm not media trained Im not studied in\nthat Im not trying to say the right\nthing Im just saying exactly what I\nfeel out of out of love the last time\nKanye West felt like he had something to\nlearn thats an interesting he says you\nknow Kanye the guy who seems to know\neverything to know whats going on for\nmusic fashion like was the last time\nKanye felt like he has something to\nlearn every day every day Im trying to\nlearn something and every day I get you\nknow I get afraid I Im Im fearful of\nthings and I just use bravery to\novercome but Im fearful of I mean the\nquote it was so cool people always say\nthe wise man knows he knows nothing yeah\nyeah Im learning and now Im expressing\nsome things that I felt and if they mean\nsomething to you at this time then great\nif not then you know dont dont use\nthem so you know a lot of you know I\nthink me and Jays issue my issue it just\ncame down to information Im super\nhungry for information Im any\ninformation more than I need validation\nmore than I need finance I need like if\nI learn how to fish then I can feed my\nfamily forever\nso Im just constantly looking for the\ninformation information how do I set up\na factory so you feel like Jay was\ntossing you money as opposed to give you\nan information you know the hit finish\nline on four four fours you know I gave\nblinking\ngave me that he gave me the money\nthats what frustrated me because\nactually the money was he got from Live\nNation he rag nation has managed me at\nthe time thats something normal that\nsomeone gives someone a touring deal it\nwas a touring deal but the fact that it\nwas worded that it came from him Im a\nvery loyal emotional like artist person\nyou know that made me feel like I owed\nmore than just the money itself for the\nfact that it came from him you know it\njust put me under a bit more of a kind\nof controlled situation as I can I dont\nIm only acting out of love I dont need\nto be controlled I just need to be\ninspired and informed and I can be the\nbest yay in that way but if I have the I\ngave you this on it and I dont have the\nfull information of how it happened now\nthat said I think there was some love in\nthat because on Jays part because he did\nhave to co-sign for it when the Live\nNations and these different companies\nwouldnt cosign for me and I was in debt\nJ did have to go up and say Im a cosign\nfor yeh so the thing is this its one of\nthose ones like have you ever done\nsomething where you did something for\nsomeone thats positive but it was\nsomething about the way you did it they\nkind of like blew the whole thing up so\nJay did something that was positive but\nthe fact that I didnt receive the\ninformation in the right way I you know\nbecause I always feel like man Im out\nhere in Hollywood Im not here like my\nmoms past I dont know who I can trust\nI dont trust nobody\nand Jay was Big Brother Big Brother you\nknow I feel like yall might have\nreacted emotionally though meaning that\nlike you reacted emotionally when you\nwas on stage and you ranted and then he\nreplied in a record you know thats not\nreally his his character to do something\nlike that\nto put out like this is what I did for\nI mean yeah but he he he did it in a\nbrotherly way you know he could have\nwent all he could released an entire\nrecord or something yeah its just a bar\nyou know they go yeah could have went\ncrazy got every single piece of\ninformation and possible all my life and\nstuff no the finances are you know so\neven like when I tweeted I was in debt\nthat gave me power that I took my power\nback because its like someone trying to\nsay like yo if you say this youre not\ngonna be cool no more and its like man\nmy financial situation dont make me\nyeah Im in debt now what and Im still\nyay yeah what you saying about myself\nbefore somebody else can use it against\nme yeah thats not called living your\ntruth to live your truth so you know you\nlive your truth nobody can use your\ntruth against you yeah you know what you\nand Jay got now were good you know we\ntweeting I mean we texting each others\npositive energy have yall seen each\nother oh I havent seen him but I I can\nfeel you know what keeps what keeps\nbrothers like yall from just you know\ncome to the house man lets have a meal\nlets sit down and talk face-to-face out\nof hock and every time I you know see\nhim doing the interview whether they\nwould let him in whoever hes saying\nthats thats my brother like I love him\nlike so what stops you off and just\nface-to-face communication go do it\nsometimes also like when you have like\nsuch similar personalities and people\nare you know creating their own\nexistence in their own world and their\nown simulation or whatever you know they\nneed to do it on their own\nyou know when we were doing watch the\nthrone I was there you know in service\nto Jay in service to myself too you know\nbut I was there where any idea the\nGivenchy artwork on watch throng like\nthe first time you ever saw the Givenchy\ndog was on ham was on a ham cover\nyou know the ODIs be the producers were\nworking with every piece of information\nwas a open source directly for you know\nmy idol for J and thats where we were\nat that time and if thats the case then\nyou know yeah hes gonna be around more\nyou know if I you know went off and you\nknow started focusing on clothes and\nbuilding my company and my you know my\nfactory and my office and just focus on\nmy family all this and you know thats\nwrap they said you went too far talking\nabout his family\ndo you feel like you go too far whoop\nends on how you look at it if were\nfamily if were brothers and we are\nfamily then is my family if were\nbusiness associates and this then it was\ntoo far you know respectfully you know\nyou know I got a say you know I was hurt\nabout I was heard about them not coming\nto the wedding\nI understand they was going through some\nthings but if his family you know youre\nnot gonna miss a wedding you know and\nIm not Im not using this interview to\nput any negative things but I got a\nstatement brother yeah I got a state my\ntruth like and then that one thing\nhappens and another thing happens\nanother thing happened other things\nhappen you just start come up with all\ntype of crazy ideas in your head and\nstuff like why and it obviously its me\nIm like wow our personality and stuff\nIm like the cousin you cant bring\nnowhere all this type of stuff obviously\nbut if interested about the wedding\ndid they not come because it you know in\nthe press it was Beyonce has a problem\nwith\nyou know they dont like all the\nkardashian reality-show\ntype thing about maybe now in hindsight\nmaybe it was cuz they had their own\nissues that they was trying to work out\nwhat do you think of what Im not sure\nIm past it\nbut at the time I was heard about it did\nyou ask them I dont think I have asked\nthem that question directly maybe\ntalking through someone I work with them\nand that kind of thing but yeah I think\nyou gotta address what bothers you yeah\nI think thats what might be causing or\nIm what causes the breakthroughs you\nknow when youre not asking the things\nthat you want to ask like those are\nquestions you can get answers for like\nsome things you cant get answers for\nbut that way you can get an answer for I\ndont think the answer fixes it true\ntrue I want to go back to something you\nsaid speaking about fixing something\nlike how did you as a man forgive\nyourself for you know you said you feel\nlike you let your wife down cuz you hide\nthe security how did you get over that\ncuz thats not your fault\nthats chance I mean she wasnt here I\nwould never forgive myself you know its\njust bugged out when youre super a high\nprofile and this celebrity the concept\nof celebrity youre like as famous as\nthe president but you dont have\nnational national guard with you you\ngotta hire your own you got to make your\nown like you know community guard this\nis a constant thing basically the idea\nof security and the rave relates to Fame\nand this not all that its like yeah\nespecially with you know social media\nand all these different things and like\noh thats like my wife doesnt even wear\nbig diamonds anymore we dont keep no\njury no money in the house\nno you know named high art none of that\nwe dont keep any of that any place you\nknow where our kids day\nyou know I wanted to think I talked to\nmy therapist about though because its\nits a very vulnerable feeling being a\nfather and a husband because our job is\nto protect and provide but shall we not\nschool right now like anything can\nhappen you know youre not with your\nwife all the times on anything can\nhappen so its kind of like a very\nvulnerable feeling like you almost gotta\nlet go and let God\nso to speak mm-hmm you know you think um\nyou think its easy to be fearless when\nits just you that you have to worry\nabout but you know now being a husband\nand a parent does it make you more\nafraid to take more chances yeah but you\ngot to stay brave you have to follow\nyour gut feeling you know I have\neveryone has a position in the universe\nand you know Ive been made and had the\nexperiences Ive had for a reason\nto be expressive to to to go through\ngoing to the hospital to go through the\ndynamics of you know family brother\nworking relationships you know I got to\nfollow my gut when I had that fear I\nstill have to be you know brave you know\nI think is a interesting in this world\nits like looking for sound bites like\nwe talked about the J thing its like\nyou know what I do love J and I dont\nhave all the answers for every issue\nIve ever had I dont have a soundbite\nfor everything thats why yeah you said\nsometimes a language is overrated form\nof communication like words dont always\ndo it do it justice I saw something you\ntweeted and it was to the effect of us\nsome things cant be explained something\njust need to be experienced mm-hm\nwhatswhats that respond I met a little\nbit when you want to express yourself a\nlot of times words can get in the way\njust this innate feeling that we have\nyou know what someones talking to you\ntrying to talk you into something with\nsomething like that and you just like\nlook this just dont feel right you know\noftentimes people playing ball doing\nkarate whatever it is they and people\nthat they dont miss your karate since\nyou see a little karate films like but\nit always be you know get out of your\nhead go from your gut go from your Chi\ndo what you feel and thats what Im big\non stop strategizing so much stop\nsetting so many plays stop doing things\nonly based in fear like the universe\nwill assist you when you are acting in\nlove all right we did this thing I said\nwhen youre acting in love youre like a\ndrop of water and you have the ocean as\nyour army when you act in fear its just\nyou and your money now you could take\nyour money and put in a Bitcoin put a\ncredit form put in a cash or all your\ncashed and then and then stand up to the\nocean and whos gonna win Im\nunderstanding I think your mind stayed a\nlittle bit more like when you was on\nstage and youd be going into the ranch\nhmm it was out of fear you were afraid\nat that time I think those rents I think\nto do the rents though were brave I\nthink were in a place now where bravery\nis more important than perfection\nfeeling is more important than thought\npeople get so they put so much thought\ninto it whats gonna happen so I\nactually think that the rants came from\na place of bravery and I had enough of\nthe politics you know and thats the\nworld that were in right now like\npeople are speaking that truth\nyou know people are expressing their\nselves and you know Ive been waiting\nfor this Ive been waiting for this\nmoment because its always been such a\nyou know just a political ear and you\nknow society and mentality that\neveryones been in and stuff like dont\ndo that you need to do this you need to\nyoull need to hang out with them you\nneed to hang out with them you know all\nthis and like trying to please people\nand all that stuff and I dont feel like\nright now like people are trying to\nplease people the same way they trying\nto please themselves that could be a bad\nthing right because I feel like were\nall public servants at the end of the\nday were here to serve the needs of the\npublic were all greater than ourselves\nwell we definitely touch on the word\nback and the idea of good and bad things\njust are it depends on what side you are\nand if something is good or bad it\ndepends on what your agenda is but of\ncourse we can speak in terms of that you\nknow we we havent got our language\nhasnt evolved to what either of us are\nfeeling at this point so both of us\nthats when this is dropping so do you\nalways think the plaintiff played in the\nfuture yeah I guess we dont I guess we\ncould be in the future people got to\ncatch up yeah you talked about the\npolitics you know you said on stage I\nwas saying that with the word bad top\nstudents bad as a consequence people are\npeople\npeople are so raised on the idea of home\nteam away-team positive negative good\nbad like I think negative gets too much\nof a negative rap you know you its life\nis a balance I dont believe in any good\nor bad experiences I feel like\neverythings just a part of the process\nof life yeah you know you think about\nbad experiences that have happened to\nyou do you still look at them as just\nbad or did you learn something from them\ntheres no bad and theres no enemies\neven people want to kill you Im not\nyour enemy\nthats something I was gonna tweet and I\nwas like I feel this but I dont know if\npeople would take it in a certain way\nIve got a lot of ideas that a Ford and\nyou know Im just gonna keep building\nlike a mountain the mountain of like a\nsnowball snowball our ideas and just\nkeep getting more and more more more\nexpressive as I go oh but you know I\ndont even know if its a book its like\nstream its all about streams everything\nis straight thats why thats an amazing\nwork thats an amazing modern and\nfuturistic word streams streams of\nconsciousness streaming music everything\nis just a stream Lakes the water you\nknow its like exactly you know where we\nwill be we will be ultra light being\nultra light stream we will be all just a\nstream\nI feel like Kanye with the brand well\nKanye was the man in rebelling against\nKanye was the brain you know my email is\nnot act on us you are retired from\nwhatever that meant to be Kanye West I\nthink the spirit my spirit my attitude\nis a representation of fighting for your\nown truth will live like if I die\ntomorrow they would live past me the\nyeah its like a hawk thing its a\nthats your name theres like Kanye West\nyeah and it means the only one you know\none of the incredible things I thought\nabout when I went to the hospital is on\nKendricks album theres the skit what\nmy opinion mm-hmm\nyou know one of the things that was\nincredible when I you know got out of\nthe hospital was I had lost my\nconfidence\nKanye was with no confidence I was like\nMichael Jordan with no jumping yeah like\nand you could see it thats what I was\nsaying sunken place all this stuff you\nknow its like and Wow I never had the\nempathy for people who lacked confidence\nI had so much of it I didnt know what\nit was like to be without it you mean\nzero confidence you just was less\nconfident in usual\nit just wasnt Black Panther Superman\nlevel confidence it was you know it was\nplaced into the simulation and shit I\nwas like completely could be like molded\nand controlled and everything if that\nwas the case if I was you know when I\nwouldnt speak up you know I you know\nIm speak up and so I like where I was\nand I got in the hospital\nits even when I did the next fashion\nshow you know it it got all these good\nreviews yeah cuz I was less confident\nbecause its like theyre there boy\nthats exactly what we wanted I didnt\ntrade it I just didnt have I didnt\nhave me I didnt have my confidence so\nthats superpower could never like if I\nwas like homeless any situation you\ncould take everything you could black\nmirror me you could put shit on the\nmedia and say yay fuck to go no doubt at\nall this type of shit and you will not\ntake my confidence away what did the\nacne decision what took Kanyes\nconfidence thats like thats literally\nlike somebody bringin kryptonite to\nSuperman thats what I dont know\nexactly what it was it had something to\ndo I mean maybe a doctor could give an\nexplanation but I had to do or something\nwith coming\nthrough the breakthrough I like to call\nit the breakthrough and at the breakdown\nuh coming through the breakthrough that\nyou know but also I think isnt it was\nincredible because it was a forced\namount it was forced humility tonight\npositive and negative I like a humility\nit just is what it is but previously I\nwould have looked at humility is more of\na negative thing and even if you read\ncertain definitions its its kind of\ngot a negative vibe but as we said\nbefore no positive or negative but also\nthat humility gave me time to to grow\nand everyone just backed off a lot to a\nlot of people depend on me they asked\nfor a lot of things theyre like\nSuperman do this for me and you know one\nof the things that the the irony because\npeople always heard about the sunken\nplace and yeah that I never saw the mean\nbut I could I could I get the picture of\nit the funny thing about that is that my\nwife like shes like Im responsible\nyou like yeas mom has passed away Im\nresponsible to take care of this\nsuperhero and my mom might have had\nthese things where she made sure I never\ntook my Superman cape off you know I got\nthis wrap that say parents are the\nstrippers strip kids that he confidence\nteach white dominance question your\ncommon sense\nIve been Washington tradition the\narmrest hopped off the Amistad and made\nIm a god now when I said it I liked it\nfor this interview when I said it on a\nsong I dont like the frequency of it\nbecause it felt dated because it touched\non race too much so its not that not\nthat race them we definitely are dealing\nwith racism but I want to push future\nconcepts you know now Im doing Im\ngiving you two streams of constants in\none I want to talk about my wife I also\nwant to talk about Harriet\nfucking he said Im good\nthat was the moment that I wanted to use\nbill\nwhy its like when you just see like on\nthe slave movies its like why you got\nto keep reminding us about slavery why\ndont you show us but Michael Jordan or\nwith a slave who rebelled oh I heard\nthat turn in a different frequency\nthough they kind of were like you when\nyou say you didnt feel like being\ncontrolled yeah you know what its funny\nlike my boy Tremaine tweet it you know\npicture of me and Virgil and he said\nMalcolm X Martin Luther King and all\nthese people got mad like how can you\ncompare them to that man I know this is\ngonna cause an uproar but certain\ncertain icons its just too far in the\npast and not relatable and thats what\nmakes them safe like theyll let you go\non the Grammys and talk about slavery\nand all that and racism because its not\ntalking about buying stock its not\ntalking about buying property\nyeah economic empowerment yeah its not\ntalking about economic town you can\ncomplain as hard as you want on that\nplatform and but its not scary well\nthats what ultimately got Martin King\njr. killed like it wasnt when he was\nfighting for civil rights since when he\nstarted talking about economic\nempowerment he was planting things like\nthe the poor peoples March which will\nbe the largest march on Washington with\npeople of all colors that would just\npoint us in franchise thats when he\ntook Martin uh Harry how the comparison\nwith birds Universal was saying that he\nhis hes more Martin Im more Malcolm\nbut there is a civil rights element to\nthe ability to create your own industry\nbecause even when we did wrap everything\nwe got basketball and rap are both\nsomeone elses industry\nso youre always a player it took\nMichael Jordan a long time to become an\nowner with that say because you\nmentioned Virgil like hes not a\ncreative director for Louboutin\nI feel like he went from being a owner\nwith off-white to not being a player how\ndo you how do you feel about that some\npeople have to do things just to prove\nthat they can be done and whether they\nbecome the billionaire that other dial\non the other side of it you know Obama\nwent into that office as a public\nservant in a service position and it\ndidnt matter the amount of money it\ndidnt matter the amount of ownership\nthe world the world needed to see that\nthis was a possibility\nso for Virgil its like the world just\nneeds to see things you know I was\nafraid to speak the way I speak now I\nwas afraid to show you you know my my\noffice in Calabasas I was afraid to show\npurchased that Im building my first\ncommunity on my first five properties on\nbecause you know I felt like it would be\nshut down but its not about me even if\nI got killed tomorrow and they shut\neverything down the fact that I put the\nidea out is the Black Panther shit that\nis a kid watching this in high school\nand a kid in college because at a\ncertain point you know pop at a certain\npoint he just had some message and hand\nthe baton hes like I might not be here\nI mean I changed the world\nI mean fuck yes the seed and somebody\nelse that may change yeah and thats the\nthing the problem is obviously\nself-preservation is the first law of\nnature but people wont\nhand over coats completely to the next\ngeneration out of just protecting\nthemselves like some of the stuff we\ntouching on is very scary and Im having\nto be brave to talk to you about it\ntheres so many elements in our life\nthat create an icon that youre supposed\nto look youre supposed to feel like you\nnot as good as the icon mmm I have an\nissue with that Im just going to say\nbacklash whatever I have an issue with\nideas that are presented that make you\nfeel less for your entire life look at\nhuman beings is more than men or more\nthan women yeah and then we need to do\nsomething thats human yeah like oh\nweve let let us down oh yeah bro when I\nwas in the hospital especially the black\npeople that worked at the hospital and I\nwas on that hospital bed and I felt like\nthey were like my family members and I\nlooked at him and there in their eyes\nand I dont know it was like the tribe\nor something like as much as I want to\nsay were one race one humanity one\nliving organism you know there is an\nelement of the black celebrity in\nAmerica and when I was laid out on a\nhospital bed looking through the window\nand a black UCLA employee I felt like I\nhad left them down I felt like they was\nlooking at me like just shaking it that\njust sad its like oh thats Jane hey in\nthe hospital bitch thats our gay bro\nlike thats thats I da juice like he\ncant like they cant they cant break\nhim is your tribe though I think I think\nyou know one of the one of the big\nmoments was when you met with Donald\nTrump and I think that led a lot of\npeople down you know the funny thing is\nI always think about that Dave Chappelle\nskit of the was Benjamin Big C yeah\nlike they created you know some of the\nblonde reasons right yeah the client\nraces and stuff like Clayton Bigsby\nright its like I felt like when I came\nout and express what I said and when I\nfelt that was almost like a Clayton\nBigsby moment when everybodys head\nexploded like my yay George Bush dont\ncare about black people connect in any\nway this dude has to like dis Trump at\nall point at all costs\neverything about and it was some\ndynamics to this so many people around\nme said dont express your feelings why\nyour brand youre this youre that\nyoure that you said you would have\nvoted for thats the feeling you talk\nabout right yeah that feeling yeah\nbecause people first thing they say is\nracism they say well what makes George\nBush more any more racist than trouble\ntheres a question what my friend asked\nme my response is well racism isnt the\ndeal-breaker for me if that was the case\nI wouldnt live in America\nthats original oh no as a rich yeah I\ndo racism I do it just basically in this\ngated community above all accepted I do\nit so\noh I got love for Obama I got love for\neverybody every human being that ever\nexisted but I felt like Obama was\nperfect he was almost like Nike or is\nwhere if you saw or Nike when I was at\nNike that Nike that like when I was that\nif you so in the good with everything\nand you got your whole thing planned on\na strategize if you have like a rogue\ncharacter like me that comes in and says\nwe need to do this for Chicago we need\nto do this to the dead you got to take\nit with a grain of salt youre gonna be\ncordial youre gonna be all you know all\nthat but youre like youre not really\ngonna change anything you know night\nwhen I was at Nike they werent willing\nto change anything they feel Knight who\nhave the most respect for I have respect\nParker you know I just got to speak out\nas a parent you know and apologize to\nthis man forever speaking ill on his\nname and his company because he gave me\nthat shot when we did the original easy\nat Nike and he was there with me I was\non a plane with him I was sketching and\nhe said look at this schedule because\nthis guy a chance and he put me next to\nTinker Hatfield and its me and Don C\nmaking the first easy but Tinker\nHatfield in mark Parker\nthat was the squad that made the\noriginal Nike easy so I just want always\nwanted to express that as a father and\nyou know and when my karma comes you\nknow Ill accept it in real time\nyou know like Kill Bill you know when\nthat karma comes to get you people I got\na frustration sometimes yeah but I got\nsome karma waiting on me\nso but I just wanted to express that\nbecause were putting into the universe\nonly good energy and every moment was a\ngreat moment because if Mark Parker\nhadnt given me that moment well then he\nhelped turbocharged me and the\ncombination Louis Vuitton doing Vuitton\nsneaker and Nike sneakers come out the\nsame time so they helped turbocharged me\nand I had a conversation with my friend\nand Chriss house down the street and\nyou talk about some rich legacy Ill\ntell you some just a regular man shit\nthat every man deals with my girlfriend\nhas a child we have a baby you make\ndecisions in your life based on\nproviding for your family\nId love thank you I loved a Nike I have\nto put the IDI on it for the\nstockholders so but when I was you know\nyoung I used to sketch the swoosh\neverything you know so it was\nheartbreaking for me to have to leave\nNike but they refused to allow me to get\nroyalty on my shoe and I knew I had the\nhottest shoe in the world I knew Yeezy\nwas the hottest brand in the world if I\ncouldnt get royalties they just said\nshoes and well give some of the\nproceeds to your favorite charity but it\nwas nothing to build no now we building\nfactories they wouldnt let me build\nanything they trying to create a\ngenerational well yeah and just put out\nmore amazing ideas to the world both\nthings generational wealth more ideas my\nfriend\nwas that Chriss house and expressed to\nme that he had received a royalty\nbecause he was a store and Im easy and\nthey wouldnt give me a royalty that was\nlike the final straw I was talking to\nPuma and talking adidas the dude that\ndidnt\nPuma definitely needs to lose his job\nand so like Im not gonna say his name\nbut he imagined so because you know with\nthat infrastructure and these ideas and\nthis connection I have it wasnt no way\nit wasnt gonna be a unicorn you know\nEasys a unicorn billion-dollar company\nwe were at fifteen million two years ago\ngonna hit a billion this year its never\never been heard of so that make you\nanxious they give you okay its what\nits supposed to be you know if I really\nhad some percentage that related to my\nactual influence Id be like a multi\ntrillionaire so thats fine no so I made\nthe decision and I left and I went with\nsomeone that would allow me to build\nsomething you know I can call the CEO of\nAdidas directly I have a cell phone\nMark Parker wouldnt get on the phone\nwith me really I dont even think you\nshould be apologizing to him if you\ncant even give you a courtesy call yeah\nyou know theyd say things like I dont\nknow why people like the easy and you\nknow Ferriss so and the funny thing is\nlook at Naik now literally all the\npeople that ever work with me are like\nthe hottest people at Nike now like they\ngave them the deals because we left and\nrip their heads off how did that make\nyou feel when they leave you to go back\nto a place that stifle job basically who\nyou saying they even talk about like the\nopportunity they got families bro you\nknow these corporations they provide an\nopportunity these are my friends they\nhave families\nif Im not gonna provide on the same\nopportunity Im not gonna stand in their\nway either but you are providing them\nthe same opportunity its just more of\nyou fella building something as opposed\nto something that already exists now a\nlot of times people like the room the\nspace you know when you get such a big\ncorporation you could build up your own\nbrand next to it if youre really you\nknow close to me its just gonna be my\nbrand so people you dont want to build\ntheir own brand actually need to be as\nfar away from me as possible to just to\nget out of the shadow kind of way\nbecause you know youd be a Kanye West\nthe heat that you bring heats them up\njust enough like I wouldnt know a\nVirgil\nhe hadnt been Kanye was his creative\ndirector creative collaborator whatever\nyou wanted to call it yeah its\ninteresting how all unfolds and you feel\ndifferent ways theres a lotta theres\nmixed emotions there like all this is my\ncrew my crew was working for Nike\nkilling it you know I want my crew next\nto me because like when I get on the\nphone with Virgil thats my you know\nthats my team hes mine hes like the\nstrategist Im the emote ER Im like\nTesla Im thinking of all the ideas like\nNikola Tesla that I got the car and Im\nthinking of all these ideas and Virg was\nable to take all of those ideas and then\narchitect them because he is an\narchitect like you had school for\narchitecture but also this is great\ntraining you know people got a like I\nheard Nike does stuff like sends people\nto business school but theyre still\nlike a Nike mm-hmm like best believe Don\nMatt Virgil Jerry still Donda at the end\nof the day Louis Vuitton is still Don\ndone at the end of the day so I know we\ngo were going to head back to the\npresidential thing so yeah I want to go\nback to merge the two lets go back to\nthe president thing Im still trying to\nfigure out what\nit relates the truck see Obama came to\nme before he ran for office and he met\nwith me and my mother to let me know he\nwas gonna run for office because I am\nhis favorite artist of all time because\nI am the greatest artists of all time\nyou know it makes its you got a good\ntaste\nyeah you got his confidence back no Im\njust saying that its a flat statement\nup to this point you know after after me\nthere will be greater you know but this\nis this is yay like this is like past\nanything thats happened up to this\npoint this is the best even the Michael\nJackson Prince Stevie Wonder whoever\nelse want to throw out there cuz I throw\nout there I throw Howard Hughes in there\nthough Henry Ford or Walt Disney I know\nSteve Jobs gotcha in there also so you\ncant say its a lock or something like\nthat is a matter of opinion\nyeah and then a barbershop debate there\nright its not even a debate its just\nthe truth this yeah its man when you\nwhen you when you the greatest is funny\nman you know I mean like Ali lived a\ngreat life you got to know who you are\nabsolutely you got to know who you are\nso Obama looks like yeas like my\nfavorite artists I want you to support\nthe runner for office Michael this is\ndope you know theyll get black\npresident\nStews Mac whos from you know Chicago\nthen when I went on stage and it would\nbe good if this video didnt get out but\nyou saw the video we called you jack oh\nyeah you know he never called me to\napologize just that the same person that\nsat down with me and my mom I think\nshould have communicated to me directly\nand then like yo yay\nyo you know what he said Im in the\nwrong this is a joke you know what why\nhe said that though let me at that time\nsome words from Obama probably could\nhave helped ease the situation not a\nlittle bit I mean as opposed to calling\nyou a jack I havent pour more fuel on\nthe fight you know no nobodys perfect\nI love Obama Im sure yeah Im sure\nwell hang out go to Richard Bransons\nisland or whatever you know me itll be\ncool I just think that we were in a\nperiod where you know yeah its so much\nstuff to do what he couldnt deal with a\nyou know wild car like me I think thats\ntoo unpredictable someone that wasnt\nbeing controlled by strategy and\nthoughts with someone whos acting or\nfeelings we knew that already up to that\npoint though I mean if anything when you\nsaid George Bush talked about black\npeople on stage in front of millions\nlive people should have realized that\nthat woman we cant control that guy\nyeah you think you think people would\nhave realized that wouldnt ya guess\nthey didnt\nso in our counter I felt away a little\nbit about Obama that Im your favorite\nartist you play touch the sky at your\ninauguration and now all of a sudden\nKendrick and J and all these all the\npeople you invited to the White House\nlike now these yo favor rappers now and\nI I got a problem with these rappers but\nyou know Im your favorite but Im not\nsafe hmm\nbut thats why you love me so just tell\nme you love me thats all and tell the\nworld you love me dont tell the world\nIm a jackass Im fighting hard enough\nsomething about me going onstage was\nsimilar to what you was doing\ncuz Im fighting to break the simulation\nbreak the setup that didnt make no\nsense\nits not that Im particularly fighting\nfor Beyonces video it was every time a\nword show has ever done that just\nfucking with artists we are HSP highly\nsensitive\npeople artists thats what you love\nabout us so youre gonna line up a whole\nbunch of artists and put us at some bum\nago and lined up trying to wait for a\ngold statue and you gonna make us feel\nlike shit you know its five of us that\nyou and four of us got to go to the\nrestaurant what our friends about hey\nwere nothing fuck yeah fuck that I\nremember you said that you was upset cos\nBeyonce said she would refuse to perform\nat the VMAs unless she won the award I\nwas one of their I think other\nSacramento you went on there right now\nyou know what I dont know if thats\ntrue I dont I dont I honestly dont\nknow if thats the true thing I was like\nan alternative fact now fake news you\nput up there know if someone told me\nthat oh okay but I havent heard that\nfrom her and its not confirmed theres\nnot an obvious truth so that showed you\nlike people put thoughts in your head to\nseparate you know its people who play\nboth sides people also my switching\nsides theres people who will literally\ntalk to you that I get a piece of\ninformation drop a negative piece of\ntalk to other side get some of his meat\nor drop- piece of information on both\nsides and then I show up like whats up\nyou know so I dont know so I could talk\nto I could talk to them directly its\nneither here nor there to me but at that\npoint when I was on my way to the\nhospital that was that affected me\nbecause Im pure mm-hmm its like you\ndont appreciate pure its like if you\ndont appreciate pure this is like more\nnobama thing like you know I appreciate\npurity you know you dont understand\nthem amount of bravery that it takes to\nAmerica and famous like the amount of\ngreat like Richard Pryor has this piece\nwhere he talks about that he says like\ntheres no such thing as someone making\nit and remaining pure like Im talking\nyears old\ngot a family Im famous I got a\nbillion-dollar business and Im speaking\nto you in a stream yeah that that\nbothered me but Im not saying I have a\nproblem with that I just want to put\nthis out to the universe just to just to\nkind of give some people something to\nthink about\nno its interesting its like a its a\nvery Gemini thing you know you see the\ntraits you see the in you and in the\npockets like whats wrong with\nexpressing how you fail and I mean you\nget to this point where youre Kanye\nWests tuple start a brand and its like\nthey want you to be everything but human\nbeings got emotions no one should be\neverything but you but you yeah but were\nyou gonna say no this interview if you\nfeel the way about you know something\nyou heard that Beyonce didnt you feel\naway about Obama calling you a jackass\nyou should be able to express that oh\nyeah and then I also like had a problem\nyou know that Obamas from Chicago in\nChicago is the murder capital of the\nworld you know I had a number of things\nthat made me say just like how theres\nraces Trump supporters and theres\nthings where Im like well maybe this\ncould make a difference you felt like\nPresident Obama could have like waved\nthe magic wand and just got Chicago\nright its not a magic wand you know\nwhat its not his fault man you see my\ngray hair on that man you dont know\nwhat that man was doing I mean you could\nonly imagine but just it took everything\nfrom everything in that mans spirit and\nsold and thats a mention racism every\nsentence this man was a Jackie Robinson\nof politics you know hes the first\nperson to do it so you know we want to\nbe supportive and be aligned also but\nthis isnt like a an absolute soundbite\nthis is an opposite this is an absolute\nopinion on either one its complex its\ncocked this is complex because these are\nvoices I might be President one day\nyou know so I might be in that situation\nwhere\nits harder for me to explain to the\nmasses why something isnt happening\nthat they feel that the concept of a\npresident should be able to fix so to\nObama I will say that I understand bro\nlike I understand I understand like JD\nthat coming to the wedding they just had\nan altercation I understand but I have\nmy feelings also all right so its\ncomplex when I cant even spoke to Obama\nwas that the last time when he met you\nin your mom we did a fundraiser a for\nmidterm for them in San Francisco and we\ndid a performance for them and right\nbefore I went on stage someone let me\nknow that he had left didnt even get to\nsee him that day I saw beforehand for\nokay\nyeah he left right before you performed\nyeah that made you feel the way I felt\nway brother just told reach out to the\nbrother Im sure just let him know like\nI feel away history this interview all\nright talk yeah I felt do it Ill be\nfilling away feeling I got feelings bro\nhe feeling away bro Ill be feeling love\nyou hey Id be feeling a way because\nthese are people that youve assisted\nand helped him maybe possibly get to the\npoint that they act and then when they\nget there they dont give you that same\nlove and return a support and return\nwhen you need it\nnobody owes me anything but Im still\ngonna feel what I feel all right\nand I understand thats the thing where\nsometimes a conversation can help show\nrespect for a situation you know look I\ncouldnt do this because of these\nreasons you know how it is see my gray\nhair its crazy I hear Im the leader of\nthe free world yeah sorry for calling a\njackass\nI appreciate your honesty\nI appreciate your Gemini your to Pacus I\nappreciate that somebodys gonna do it\nbecause Im friends I cant do it but I\nappreciate that somebody its still\nwilling to do it thats why I got the\ninterview with you\nand Im saying you go off truth you know\nas you risk your life for your truth you\nknow in the in the feeling what was the\nfeeling that made you say you know what\nI want to go meet with Donald Trump and\nwhat yeah are we talking about when that\nhappened when that the yang with no\nconfidence we got the yeah who was kind\nof figured things out what yeh was that\nyeah but Im not going back down at that\nIm gonna Im not gonna let myself off\neasy\nmm-hmm by saying are met with Trump just\ncuz I was going through something I am\ngonna give the universe that mm-hmm no\nIm a face it and they gonna face me\nthis was the yeh that wanted to do\nsomething to change something and I\nwould meet with him today and I would\ntalk about Chicago first talk about some\nmore things we could eventually get into\na lot of you know elements but we start\nthere\nyou think he cares about black people\nwhat do you think nominated what hit you\nwith a question to your question I hate\nwhen people do that are you\nthats fire cuz you use the George Bush\nquote against me about black people come\non honey all when you met with him he\nhadnt even really been you know acting\npresident now hes got a yearand dog\nbelt\nnothing good has come of Donald Trump\nbeing in the White House other than\npeople starting to build their own like\nhe talked about when you left\nNike because Nike wouldnt allow you to\nbuild your own but I think Donald Trump\nis forcing us\nto build a home its a difference bro\nIm doing my landscaping the back of my\ncrib rich nigga shit right the before we\ncould put all the trees and add the\nbeauty you got to break some things if\nyou keep on getting just the beauty just\nthe perfect thing just the Obama walk\nthrough the hard way it just see you\ndont even why his feet dont even touch\nthe floor he just floating\nyoure very a handshake and all that you\nknow man you get all of these images\nthis is what it is this is what I wanted\nto talk about the idea of black\nperfection like a black person cant be\nimperfect in the public eye thats a\nform of control Im here to show you\nimperfection the beauty is in the\nimperfection that this is possible but\nIm sitting there at the award show and\nIm like man this is the Staple Singers\nthey play ball here yall gonna sit\nthrough this and put this lit this my\nmanipulation tell you that you know\nsomeone I you know Im gonna put no\nenergy were keeping a father it is you\nlike that thats what they used to say\nabout Morocco Morocco had to be perfect\nbecause if he wasnt perfect and you\nprobably would never get another one\nyou know thats like the virtual\nsituation right you know I feel like I\nfeel like Baracks brother a little bit\nyou remember when Baracks brother was\ntalking a little bit before if I shut up\nyou know its like because its complex\nwith Louis Vuitton you know as me and\nVirgil went and infiltrated fashion\nwhich is what we did he started to learn\nabout it\nhe started I got this thing Im a tweet\nlater into the road on my retreat that\nwas you know you look at this mountain\ntop and at the top of the mountain its\nall these tools for life\nso you proceed you say I need these\ntools in order to win it life so you\nproceeded to climb up the mountain but\nyou you need tools in order to get up\nthe mountain to climb look you\ncollecting tools and stuff by the time\nyou get to the top of the mountain\nyou got more tools than ones at the top\nand thats what I figured out about\nfashion you know I talked to Virgil for\nan hour you know I realized that the\nconcept of luxury and all this is what\ndid I love about Gucci what did I love\nabout louisvil Tom I love Tom Ford\nI love the artist and Gucci created a\nplatform for the artist\nI love Marc Jacobs and Louie Vuitton\ncreated a platform for the artists its\na battle the child wont know about\nFrancois Pino Bernard Arnault Francois\nPinot is Balenciaga and Gucci okay okay\nBernardo is the richest person in\nfashion this is the head of the LVMH\ngroup like Ive been to his house before\nIve shaken hands to do a deal before\nwith this man and hes one of my idols\njust like jay-z hes cold\nyou know is he made culture before\nculture there was culture because he set\nthe platform before there was an\nInternet to hire John Galliano from st.\nMartins one of Louie soo it Wilson\nstudents hire Marc Jacobs he had the\nvision this man is a visionary you know\nhe is one of my idols\nI love Bernard I feel as he loves me\nalso so this is how it works they have\ntwo main main main schools that have\nraised the fashion icons Parsons in New\nYork and st. Martins in London Bernard\nI know\nand Pinot thats there recruiting you\nknow cant they go there and now the\nbreakthrough Virgil is now we have\nsomeone whos come from Donda its\ncomfortable school to Kanye West and I\nhear people talk about all he and go to\nschool oh we went to school all right\nhead to school we was doing JPEGs and\nJapan and we we were we were making\nPhotoshop so much and not making clothes\nthat we we started just joking about the\nJPEGs like did you shrink my JPEG did\nyou did you did you dye my JPEG and shit\nwe because we couldnt figure out how to\nactually make the clothes so we just do\nit in Photoshop and Virgil became the\nfastest Photoshop artist that Ive ever\nmet in my life wed be sitting in a you\nknow you know right before we went to\nFendi you know just photoshopping things\nin definitely win if we endure a Fendi\nbut we aint do shit bro we could do\nnothing man I was just happy to have a\nkey card you know it upset you can you\nsaid you have mixed emotions when Virgil\ngot the job did it upset you because\nthats something that you wanted like\nyou was verbal about wanting in on one\nof these fashion houses and being able\nto create for Louie Vuitton or Gucci\nwhats the thing we said about you know\nthe the tools at the top of the mountain\nyou know in the process you gain all the\ntools its the journey and that journey\nyou gain everything you need now we got\nfactories we its you know there is some\ntalk about validation need or not need\nfor validation theres some validation\nand the fact that someone that I came up\nwith is now the head of Louis Vuitton\nyou know and I said you know honestly\nyou know thats that was a slight I\nshouldnt have worried it like that\nVirgil is the head of menswear Nicholas\nGasca is the head of womens wear\nBernardo is - hey so I just want a word\nit straight straight up because every\ntime we say head its like a little bit\nof a slight - Nicholas and you know\nNicholas is the god like maybe the best\ntop top number one designer in the world\nthe original call\nbefore you took the job because that was\nsomething that you wanted to he call you\nlike you let me at least consult would\nyeah oh asking if this time I should do\nhow do you hear about it on the internet\nlike the rest of us now he made the call\ntwo minutes before he hit dinner but you\ndidnt know about the meetings or the\nstuff that was happening beforehand no\nno well we I was in the I was in Berlin\nwith rocky and he told me hes like you\nknow were looking at Im looking at\nLouboutin Im looking at Versace like he\nyou know you know like yeah Im wow you\nknow me so its all like the fact he had\nmy reputation is kind of like Devil\nWears Prada or something like that so\npeople are mindful in the way that they\ngave me information too so he didnt he\ndidnt he was like Im going to lose\nlike Versace\ngot this I got to kind of laid it out\nthen I showed him the season six\ncampaign I showed of

with her\nmeds you know maybe a year and a half\nprior to that I met with Bernardo know\nwe had a deal you know on the table that\nwe shook on I did some performances that\nthey museum and then three months later\nthe deal got dropped at the board and\nthat that that set me back in apparel a\nbit when that happened because in order\nfor me to even negotiate the deal\njust after I did season one with adidas\nI had to go to Adidas and say okay I\nknow we had the best fashion show all\nthis but Louis Vuitton is\nback you know easy in the kanye west\ncompany and these guys are masters of\nclothes so I need you to dim the father\nparallel I got paperwork for it and\nadidas say like all right okay cool we\ncool would you do two shoes\nso if you notice ever since then theres\nnever been a d dis easy clothing so when\nI did so this happened right after the\nfashion show in February I met with\nBernardo no in February we shook our\nhands on the deal and then you know his\nson called me and they said you know\nits dropped at the board we dont think\nits going to be profitable before we\nrun out of money they only wanted to you\nyoure making a new brand I know that\nwas a study talking but people need to\nget higher ceilings the shit we got to\ntalk but this soon this is Diddy talk\nyou know me or no this is what Kylie be\ntalk about this is that you know so when\nthey pullin on the deal is I went into\nseason two we didnt have any production\npartner and the collection never went to\nmarket the first collection when adidas\nhad line ups and there was nothing to\nfall back off on the second collection\nmmm-hmm due to that negotiation so the\nhurtful part of it was thats why okay\nthat makes it thats why you notice you\nknow clover yeah so the hurtful part was\nthey agreed to support my clothing and\nguess who was one of my designers murder\nVirgil then they didnt do the deal and\nwere gonna have anything to do would\nyou say so Virgil didnt have anything\nto do technically yeah I mean he was\ndoing all fight mm-hmm but you know at\nthat time we had our designers for\nVirgil da Jerry fear God dem nah dem\nlose a head of Lanciano\ndem Noahs in the apartment its me\nVirgil\njerry in this apartment one by one\nmaking season one I wore this big\nsweatshirt that my sweatshirt I remember\nyou know some people say better men\nright and then you know shortly after\nits not cuz I what sweatshirt either\nbut Troy after Timna went to Balenciaga\nand now Virgils you know at Louie\nVuitton so transitions in life you know\nas a as a business owner\nthese things are hurtful you know when\nyou have like youre working with a\ntalent like dem nah youre working with\na talent like Virgil and you know\nsomebody comes through and says BAM Im\ngonna take Virgil Im gonna take culture\nexplain to me this out a number of\nfashion yeah so why would Virgil leave a\nbrand that seems to be successful\noff-white it seems to be growing yeah\nyou know I mean why would you leave that\nbrand to go work for a Louis Vuitton a\nbrand thats already established like\nwhy wouldnt you pool your resources and\ntry to make off light that next high-end\nits like taking the job as a president\nmhm\nyou know oh you know Trump you see\nTrumps name on all type of buildings\nbut he still took the job as president\nyou have like you know this\nconversations about a creative director\nrole for me at adidas its like okay I\ngot my brand is this billion-dollar\nbrand this unicorn company is growing\nbut to be able to go itd be able to\ndirect adidas at all those stores is a\nyou know its an another conversation\nId be you know Id be open to the\nconversation of taking a job like that\nhow did that help Chicago though cuz I\nyou said you become president so now you\non this one that have all white growth\nAmy hello yeah okay price off wait went\nup soon as he went to Louie Vuitton Oh\nyeah not the price with the value of it\nthe validation of it because Louboutin\nLouboutin is the you know our man is\nreally the top luxury house where they\ncall luxury houses like anybody knows\nabout luxury anybody Bernard will say\nPervez its the top luxury house\nfamily-owned all that why do we always\nneed validation from white people rich\npeople because our Cape got taken away\nwhen hes three years old weve broken\nwe in a simulation we want our BMW we\nwant our house that we want to pay all\nour money for the house we want to buy\nthis dress for our wife we want to do\nthis one get our kids in school we want\nwe want this you know just championship\ntrophy we want this jewelry war all\nthese different things like people we\nnot monks we in the simulation we in it\nyou know said I cant talk nobody out of\nwearing Gucci and you know this is me I\nhad to come out the other side of the\nhospital and you know half like a\nRussell sweatshirt on something like\nthat\nthats me like people be calling me like\nhomeless all the time but like this is\nmy confidence where I dont wear\nbranding like that but worse than that I\nbut like I saw me a to so I can but\neveryone like they have to have that\nconfidence like what I see when I see\nbranding I see insecurity you know I see\nand I see people buying you know buying\nsecurity you know buying get back\nthrough a brand you know protection of\nbadge dont dont mess with me at high\nschool I guess supreme or you know the\njust to put the agenda for a second of\neasy and of what were doing out is our\nmission and what we fought for is to be\nable to take the best talents in the\nworld and you know land that price point\nwhich we havent done yet but thats\nwhats interesting about this interview\nI like you get to see the steps you know\nis that when you see early Jeff Bezos\nyou know theres gonna be Jeff Bezos you\nknow its just like hes standing from a\nwarehouse but were not interested in\nthe concept of high fat\nyou know the concept of luxury Im\nchanging the idea of luxury I think\nluxurious space\nI think luxury is time as a luxury\nfriends are a luxury getting your vision\nout is a luxury the ability to afford\nsomething is the luxury not to not be\nable to afford it to go in and be like\noh I can afford this thats the luxury\nthats the yeah everybody fell in love\nwith though now yeah who was so human\nand yeah who cared about things bigger\nthan brands no I hate you talk about\nfamily night he talk about friends I\nhate talking about time yeah those are\nsomething we all have those are\nvaluables that we all possess regardless\nof you know what our finances all mm-hmm\nyeah and thats the thing that we had to\ncrack the COBE the reason why we went\ninto fashion wasnt to stay there or be\nthere just do you know cool high price\nstuff it was actually to take the\nincredible HSP highly sensitive people\nthat usually end up in a fashion house\nand bring them to some place where they\ncould consistently connect with the\npublic\neasy eventually will be you know closer\nto like a relief company if theres like\na disaster were gonna dress you know\nwere gonna bring clothes and water you\nknow the same design perspective that\nto give it and eventually thats who\nwell be you look up five ten years from\nnow and easy will be the biggest service\nprovider of apparel and one by one every\nyear were going to take one two three\nten people that would have normally\nended up in a fashion house what Ann\nwent to Nike you wouldnt want other\nplaces and were going to Calabasas we\nbuild in factories you know\nI still you know Im sitting there\nlistening you talking you know I feel\nlike Kanye from four years ago would\nhave taken the job at the fashion house\nI dont feel like the Kanye Im talking\nto right now will take that job at the\nfashion house I am in too good of a\nposition to take a job where I have to\nbe away for my wife and my son and my\ndaughters that just dont make no sense\nfor what family is your most important\ncurrency I got a cousin that littered\nthe floor I flew flew out here Im\ntrying to get as much family as close to\nme as possible thats one of the reasons\nwhy Kim wont end up in a hospital she\nhad a family close\nyou feel like youre in a position to\nchange things now which are like really\nchange things I always was you know its\nmy place in the universe Ive just been\ndistracted Ive been distracted and\nmanipulated and I allow things that you\nknow my mama made me to never be\nmanipulated and gang stirred and pimped\nand all that type of shit but somehow\nstepping into the music industry it\nhappened you know like the music\nindustry is set up for you to have just\nenough money to afford a car pay for\nyour kids a house and be on tour for the\nrest of your life till you die in a\nsetup for you to literally go buy an\nhour island like Phil Knight it aint\nset up for the artist the win its like\nboxing you know more more people end up\nretarded than rich do you feel like when\nyou was in debt did that contribute to\nyour lack of confidence no Im glad he\nsaid it cuz that lets me that makes me\nthink like they have some money is what\nmade him feel confident nah thats why I\ntweeted that because I knew I had to\npower thats why I tweeted mark Mark\nZuckerberg and I tweeted the debt the\nreason I treated to Mark Zuckerberg cuz\nhe wanted to meet with me and my hung\nout with him a few times and I I got\nrespect for him\nand but when I was talking about my\nideas there was really like not a lot of\nfollow-up to that and I always see these\nuh these guys theyll go and support a\nguy thats got like one idea that they\ncan capitalize off of and then you get a\nguy thats proven and like done the\nimpossible and every single feel hes\never put his mind to and Im like yo\nhelp me get a valuation right for my\ncompany and it would be people who know\nhow to do that and Im hanging with them\nright and they dont show me how to do\nthat and its like why are you keeping\nme misinformed\nI felt like learning the valuation of\njust even the company or what I built\nwas like a slave getting a social\nsecurity number hmm its like I got my\nrights I know Im worth this much and\neveryone in Hollywood knows exactly who\nyeh is every agent anybody they know\nyeah is Jay in the hospital on stage\nrent in debt or what a billion-dollar\ncompany like the spirit is here and the\nonly thing that can hold me back is a\nlack of information but information is\nhard to define and you think its secret\ncodes like even when jay-z gave a little\nknow that tweet it or were texting each\nother like hes giving codes away hes\ngiving information but its like yo this\nis open source the basics yeah I like I\nlike its cuz Elon Musk could be like yo\nheres all my plans but hes the only\none I can pull it off I just you know we\nwork hard on that color palette right\nnow just tweeted it today like yo cuz\nits fire you know Im saying Im sure\ntheres gonna be some people that copy\nit one by one thats great the idea is\nout there hanging out with people and\nyou saying I want to do all these things\nand its just not taking you seriously\nand it keeps you in a position to be you\nknow managed in a way so my my last and\nfinal manager of Scooter Braun all right\nIve had every manager she Roberson Jay\nBrown is easy you just bought it what is\nthat about\nI just cant be managed but was dope\nabout scooter dough at the end of the\nday where you really got to give him his\nprops is one thing is he has a his\nparents were adopted a black child his\nbrothers black so this is a Jewish guy\nwho understands business understands all\nthis but also understands how to\ncommunicate you know on a personal level\nwhat a black person like on a brother\nlevel so me and scooter we just get on\nthe phone\nand we talk to me for hours and that\ninformation meant everything he was my\nlet me third person he was Calle OS\ngateway drug to business because before\nthat it was always like you were artists\nyou a rapper we love you for the music\nyeh dont dont think about nothing\nthink about business bah bah bah blah\nand I would just you know the thing we\njust talked about before we talked about\nObama and Trump in the other room we\ntalked about trust me like I would just\ntrust I trust the manager let them do\neverything them handle everything let\nthem handle you know let them hire your\nbusiness manager or this and that you\nget a manager or manager home manager\nand then it becomes one big rocket where\nits like the tour guy is talking to the\nlabel guy is talking to the manager is\ntalking to the guy that sold you the\nhouse they talk to you provide and then\nyoure just trapped you you dont youre\nnot in control of your life anymore and\nat that point you could be easily\nmanipulated you know a whole album what\nPaul McCartney can end up becoming a\nsingle for Rihanna because you know\nyoure trapped in this box of the idea\nof your perception music industry this\nthat that so the funny thing I was I\nknow I want to say in this situation is\nlike Scooter Braun is Kanye West Kanye\nWests gateway drug to business and\nmaybe the deaf of the music industry as\nwe know it really yeah why because\nartists are businesses were not just\nartists artists shouldnt have managers\nartists should have CEOs thats how I\nfeel I didnt put no thought in that you\nknow its like you know says a lot of\npeople whos gonna have a problem with\nthat statement Im gonna say how I feel\nso that means okay how many kids are\ngoing to business school right now\nwarden Harvard you think they like lets\ntake some I Travis Scott alright they\nprobably listen to his music boozy\nsomebody like that right how many Aziz\nand Travis Scots are there and how many\nbusiness people are there right Im\ngonna think its probably less Travis\ngots an Uzi\nthen there are business people so\nwouldnt you think a Travis Scott would\ndeserve the same amount of employees as\nDropbox in his first year so its some\nfriend drew mm-hmm\njust did with Dropbox but with artistry\nand artists was the point where you IPO\neveryone I want to talk to me about\ngetting out Im out this to get out yeah\nrecognize artists as a business now now\nwe want a piece of all of their business\nold slave shit so all this is yours yeah\nand what youre gonna do with it Im\ngonna build five properties so its my\nfirst community Im getting to\ndevelopment Im super anybodys ever\nbeen to any of my cribs knows Im super\ninto development homes its just the\nnext frontier for me to the to develop\nyou can do the hiking Nikes is trash\nbehind but listen its crazy though cuz\nland you want to build a community on it\nwhy does the Kanye West dont need\nnobody should I go back when we was\ntalking about with Trump you need to\nmeet with Trump you you yeah you know\nhead of state of your own shit yeah I\nfeel that you know what\nI love real change I love you no\nchallenge in the norm I love I love\npeople who dont love them I love the\nfact that they speaking up and\neverybodys just giving their opinions\nand everybodys expressing themselves I\nlove I love that Ive been waiting I\njust like Ive been waiting for this\nmoment in time its just like a yay\nmoment in time and stuff for people you\nknow my dad is an activist and you know\nmy moms activist recent marches and\nstuff I feel like that energy all coming\nto a head you know now I refuse to\nbelieve that your mother would love\nDonald Trump hmm I got differents\nopinion for my mom\ntrue true but what about when you see\nlike cuz you know thats watching this\nright now and theyre like yo you know\nDonald Trump was getting our family\ndeported and you know like especially\nyou right now youve got this whole\neconomic empowerment thing going on but\nyou got a guy like him whos clearly\ntrying to marginalize and oppress people\npeople that look like you you dont want\nto see people like you come up can you\nstill love a person like that\nI know I dont have all the answers that\na celebritys supposed to have but I\ncould tell you that\nwhen he was running its like I felt\nsomething its like the fact that he\nwant its like it proves something it\nproved that anything is possible in\nAmerica that Donald Trump could be\npresident of America Im not talking\nabout you know what hes done since hes\nbeen in office but the fact that he was\nable to do it like remember I was gonna\nrun for president\nI had people that was close to me\nfriends of mine like making jokes making\nmemes talking shit now its like oh that\nwas proven did that could have happened\nyeah so I get what youre saying\ndoctor not conventional you know me even\nfrom what were doing in fashion to me\nbeing a kid with the pink polos to me\nbeing outspoken to me being ostracized\nbecause theres a Taylor Swift thing or\nthe George Bush thing or you know who\nIm dating who are marrying what Im\ntalking about like all of this is like\nan outsider thing you know so when I see\nan outsider infiltrate I connect with\nthat so maybe I think you like the idea\nyeah not necessarily\nI do Donald Trump with the idea of an\noutside of infiltrating yeah I liked it\nit showed you that anything is possible\nshows you that it doesnt even like\nVirgil working at Louis Vuitton Trump\nbeing an office its a time for the\nunconventional Im very Im not a\ntraditional think Im a nonconformist\nmm-hmm you know so that relates to the\nnonconformist part of me now you know\nbut Im also Im a producer I like the\nsegue things I like to take ODIs chop it\nup do it like this what so whats the a\nversion the a version to be the Trump\ncampaign and maybe the Bernie Sanders\nprinciples that would be my mix and\nstuff but I think both had you know you\nknow I need it you know I hit the glass\nceiling you ever seen a bird fly into a\nwindow oh yeah they dont know its\nglass that was me when I hit the\nhospital that was a bird flying into the\nwindow and you know I could have you\nknow not made it out of it but I\nsurvived and shit but its um\nare you scared of that happening again\nyou having a breakdown Ill break\nthrough no no Im happy it happened Im\nhappy to see have gone to the other side\nand back you know theres some fools\nwhen it happened I do want us I want to\nspeak on I I want to point out the\nmoment when youre in the hospital bed\nand youre next to your friend and you\ntell them dont let this person leave my\nside and they put you inside of an\nelevator and take all your friends away\nfrom you that was the scariest moment of\nmy life he was gonna drug you or kill\nyou I was gonna get killed and you know\nmy wife wasnt in town so I told my\nmother wait Don Im awake I like dont\nleave my side until my wife gets here\nand they have this moment where theyre\nforced to leave your side thats\nsomething that has to change you know\nits like if a pregnant woman is you\nknow delivering a baby guarantee whoever\nthe people are sisters the dad they get\nto stay next to them till the baby is\ndelivered not leaving my way from that\nsituation yeah HSP you you were paranoid\neverything you dont believe nothing\nyoure just seeing through all of the\nsimulation\neverybodys phony everybodys an actor\nall the shit and then they make your\nfriends the only people you believe in\nleave your side I cant express to you\nlike how traumatizing that moment is and\nthen you waked up drugged the fuck out\nhmm so they put you on medication\nyeah are you still on any now almost\ndefinitely why were what they got you on\nIm gonna say does the medication help\nyou know I mean you you dont want to\ntell us what to do but does it help\nits an imperfect solution just call me\ndown but theres a lot of ways to calm\ndown I dont want to call me yeah were\ngonna call me a fool Davey yeah yeah\nwould you feel like that takes a little\nbit of your superpower weight off all\nthis power in being controlled and calm\nyou know x-men really understanding how\nthat really uses a power or Superman\nthats me this is like whats the\nKryptonite its gone I got the\nconfidence everything is possible\nbuilding acres raps stating of tours\ndesigns companies ideas to ignite the\nnext generations like everything is\npossible you know and Im just a vessel\nand thats my job in the universe as a\nservant to the world I have to be me Im\nnot as good of a servant if Im that yay\nyou are you know almost definitely you\nknow you are yay and I mean like uh I\nguess what I kept asking like well first\nof all talk about something that I

"Http://www.schaulager.org/smq/files/lynching_tree.jpg\nThis performance features a clear example of using symbolism to enrich the message of the song\nBlood on the Leaves tells the story of a relationship torn apart by materialism, unprotected sex, and drugs. West samples Nina Simones rendition of Strange Fruit, a song that paints a vivid picture of racial violence in the segregated South. West samples the line: \"Black bodies swinging from the summer breeze; strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.\" The frenzied, pitched up use of this line cast the song in a racial light. The characters in Blood on the Leaves become the lynched victims in Strange Fruit. Instead of racial violence, these characters have fallen victim to the perils of materialism, drugs and unprotected sex, all of which are issues that disproportionately affect the black community\nWest performed this song,already saturated with meaning, at the VMA awards in front of a purposefully lighted and positioned backdrop of a photo by film director Steven McQueen. The photo depicts a tree in New Orleans that was the site of racially charged lynchings. It’s lit and positioned in such a way that as West performs in front of it, he appears as a shadow, his erratic movements almost resembling a man hanging from the branches. The shadows of the audience’s raised hands appear at the bottom of the frame, as if coming out of the ground, representing the scores of victims buried at sites like this across America\nHttp://divaartist.com/divablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot_2013-08-26-00-20-13_1.jpg\nAfter the performance West posted a picture of the tree captioned: \"those who were murdered are buried in the ground around the tree.\"\nHttps://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1377548967_JKYK1ZZ.jpg\nThis nuanced imagery, rife with symbolism, paints a powerful and disturbing scene that adds potency to West’s message of the relics of slavery in todays society",

"If you ever see somebody next to me, know that theyre better than me at something\nSo -- bars. Bars\nSo its really good to have this event tonight which we decided instantaneously, the way we put this shit together, yall comin out here tonight vibin with us. In the way this whole albums put together. The amount of producers that came together for it and the way we worked on this shit really collectively, collaboratively. We didnt give a fuck about what nobody else said outside lookin in, anything. We just wanted to make the best product possible. And this is just the beginning of an entirely new mentality of how to make music directed for the people. What I said last night is like, we drop this shit June 18th. This aint about waitin until August and havin some big this and that. Its about deliverin some shit for yall to go to work to, ride to, listen to while yall workin out and shit. Whatever yall doin to provide a soundtrack for this shit thats gon come out. We gon keep on doin this shit over and over and over. Makin shit for my core, my cut\nWith the creative director Matt Williams and Virgil Abloh, the whole team, Don C, Ibn, all the Been Trill family, and the combination of all the people we brought together from Daft Punk workin like 3-4 joints on the album. The first joint \"Onsite\", \"I Am A God\", bless me, and Mike Dean. Travis Scott workin on the album, Hudson Mohawke, Arca. And of course, at the end, last -- wait a second, am I forgettin some people and shit?\nLast, but not last, that came and helped bring this whole shit together, the executive producer of this LP and the family, is Rick Rubin comin in and finishing up the whole shit for us. Which is legendary because everything we did on this project, everything I get like when we release Numbers on the Boards\", from the video to the \"NO ARTWORK\" to the sound of the song and everything. I was like, \"What would Rick Rubin do? What was his Def Jam shit that they were doing?\" Because I remember like Ricky would say, \"When we did Def Jam, we wasnt really feelin like we was in competition with nobody, cause this shit was so direct.\" Where we at right now? We in the middle of the city right now, over into the motherfuckin streets and nobody shuttin down shit while we makin real music and yall vibin out to this shit.. So its good for me to go to the God, Rick Rubin, and play him my shit.

"Jimmy Kimmel: My guest tonight is a 21-time Grammy award winning performer, who last month threatened his very existence by threatening one of Americas most beloved television personalities. We had a big dumb fight on Twitter, but he was nice enough to agree to come and talk about it tonight. Please welcome Kanye West!\nJK: How are you?\nKanye West: Im okay.\nJK: Im very happy that you came. Im glad you did, and I wanted to clear this up. I really felt bad about all this stuff. I did.\nKW: Mm-hmm. \nJK: I guess the first question I should ask is, who are you wearing?\nKW: Its Ralph.\nJK: Kramden? Lauren?\nJK: Is that a new grill you have there?\nKW: Nah theyve been in my mouth for three years.\nJK: That one on the bottom? OK well its good to see you.\nKW: Good seeing you too.\nJK: I guess we should talk about what happened, because I do think that somewhere in you, you want people to understand where you’re coming from is that true?\nKW: Yeah, correct.\nJK: So we did a sketch on the show where we had - you did an interview with the BBC Radio and it was an intense interview - and I’ll be honest with you, I only saw a couple of little parts of the interview when we did this sketch.\nKW: Yeah, that’s what I thought.\nJK: In fairness, there was context to it and we took it out of context. And we had a couple of little kids reenact it. Which I didn’t think would be something that bothered you. Do you mind if we show a little clip of it?\nLittle Kanye: Ive reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting. Im not trying to regurgitate myself. Im a product person: not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could think about! Brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no! How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants?!\nJK: Im gonna tell you something, the truth is the main reason I did that is because I like to see kids curse. I think it’s funny. And I think that some people read into it differently that we were positioning you as a child, but that’s not true. In fact, we’ve done this to other people, with Lady Gaga, with quite a few people that weve had kids say what they said and reenact them. Of course this is not something you knew. And this is not something that people who just watched it online or whatever knew. And you called me. A lot of people think this is some kind of publicity stunt that you and I cooked up. But this isnt, right?\nKW: I mean everyone out there in TV world, real world, whatever world you stay in, needs to know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my life. Any time I went up and spoke my mind, whether it put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was always what I thought was the truth. Whether Im like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever I felt emotionally. I dont follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to say. So I don’t do publicity stunts, period. So don’t ever think that.\nJK: Me neither guys. So we talked on the phone, and I didn’t really know why you were calling. I heard you were upset. But I didnt know the context, and we had a bad conversation, right?\nKW: Yeah, I knew you before. And I saw you at a wedding and I remember you telling me, I want people to know this side of you and different things like this and I saw this good guy at the wedding. So when I saw the skit - which I didnt watch all the way through because I didnt want to be infuriated - I was like I know you. So it was a combination of me knowing you, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad headline on the cover of In Touch. And me not knowing this person. So I was like this is the one person I know. So I can go and let out everything that I feel about every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that people feel is ok to treat celebrities like zoo animals or act like what theyre saying is not serious, or their life is not serious or their dreams are not serious. And you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we just had as men… that elevates sometimes, you take a guy, Jimmy does his thing. And I do my thing and at a certain point these egos can flare up and we kind of just took it back to high school for a minute.\nJK: And I got beat up a lot in high school, So I didnt wanna go back to high school.\nJK: And this is something that to be honest with everyone, this is something that when youre with another celebrity we complain about. This zoo animal, its a perfect thing, because people online they just want you to click through so theyll put whatever they can put as a headline to get you to click through and it can be damaging and I think people look at you and they go, \"this is a guy who’s got millions of dollars, hes got a beautiful wife and a new baby, we can’t possibly hurt this guy.\" And to be honest, even though I’m in that same position too - I dont have a baby - it’s not something that comes to my mind when I’m cooking up a comedy sketch. And some of these things are hurtful, and the truth is important. And its... but on the other hand, I will say a lot of times you I think you bring it on yourself, this kind of misunderstanding about you.\nI personally found it odd to be in the position that I was in because I often… I don’t know if you know this, a lot of people think you’re a jerk. And I often, in my own personal conversations, say, no, I know this guy, he is not a jerk. In fact I think we have a picture which I happened to see on my Dads iPad at the wedding and its you and my Dad - who you may have though was Wolf Blitzer in fairness - but I mean to go to a wedding of a friend of mine and you took a Southwest Airlines flight to that wedding just to make it for this guy who was just a coworker and then to be so nice to everyone there, that tells me a lot about you. Everyones nice to me when they meet me because they know I have a talk show and almost everyones on their best behavior. But what I observe is how celebrities behave around other people - how they treat our staff and how they treat in this case my family, and I’ve always said that to people about you. And I think thats important for... I know part of you doesn’t care, I see you onstage saying, \"I don’t want to hold your baby, I’ll drop your baby on it’s head…\" you know I don’t believe any of that stuff when you say it.\nKW: I’m not running for office, I’m just here to make good music, make people feel good when they hear my music. And you know when I did that interview, I was really vocal about a lot of things that Ive been dealing with over the past 10 years, when I was put in the classification of “just a celebrity.” Because you know for me, I’m a creative genius and there’s no other way to word it. I know you’re not supposed to say that about yourself, and I say things the wrong way a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I wanna bring more things to the world, I want to help the world. I want to make peoples’ lives easier. I spent 2 of my checks in telemarketing when I was 18 years old on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is before there was H&M and Zara, you couldn’t just find cool stuff when you were growing up. And for me, I care about cool stuff. It means something to me, it means stuff to a lot of people that are like me, and that’s what I was talking about on the Zane interview.\nSo when I come on here, I can laugh and I can joke, and I can see a skit and we can say, ok we love Kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever, but for me, it’s bigger than who I am and my presence, living. It’s about when I was on Earth what did I do to help? And at what point did I hit a glass ceiling where people said you’re a celebrity so you can’t help in this box, you can’t help in this box. But I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you do music, you can do anything. Once you learn how to produce, you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors. I have an art background even before I was a musician. People told me I couldn’t rap. People had all this advice for me about how I shouldnt try to rap. And I wouldn’t even say I’m a rapper, I’m more of a messenger than a rapper.\nSo even when you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what I said. Whereas if you look at the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in my position to do. Because most people just like bow down to TV or bow down to these cameras. Like I could care less about any of these cameras, all I care about is my family, I care about protecting my girl, protecting my baby, and protecting my ideas and my dreams. And ya know thats the reason why I went so crazy.\nJK: I wanna go back to one thing you said which is when you say you’re a genius that upsets people, but the truth is a lot people think they’re geniuses, and nobody says it because it’s weird to say it, but it is most certainly more honest to say \"I am a genius\"…\nKW: I’m totally weird, and I’m totally honest, and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes. And the thing is for me to say I wasn’t a genius, I would just be lying to you and to myself.\nJK: Thats true, it’s false humility.\nKW: Oh my god. It comes with your first ticket to LA, soon as you get off the plane, here’s your false humility. Maybe if keep up with this act long enough and go with this agency theyll give you a star on the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybodys ass. But its like thats not what were doing. By the way, I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame, because they said something like they’re not gonna put my girl on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality star. Its like people are so so dated and not modern. There’s no way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a star on the Walk of Fame. Its ridiculous old concepts. And you know for me, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth. It’s like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.

"Kanye: For me, right now I’m able to talk and be here and live in LA and have a living and get engaged to my girl because I’m a successful musician currently. But if I were to write my title, like, going through the airport you have to put down what you do, I would literally write Creative Genius, except for two reasons. Sometimes it takes too long to write that, and sometimes I spell the word “genius” wrong.",

You wouldnt have Future perform and that man owned the clubs last summer\nHas anyone at the Grammys ever heard March Madness??? Yes I have a problem with the Grammys\nAll artists have a problem with it and I am going to fix it for us all starting right now\nNeil please reach out as soon as possible so we can make the Grammys culturally relevant again\nUs real music guys wanna have fun too\nAnd always remember that rock and roll was stolen and dont try to hide behind Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis 😭😭😭 all positive vibes\nFirst order of business. We the people need to see Future at the Grammys\nWe need to see Young Thug at the Grammys. Not just me and Jay in a suit\nPeople ask why I speak in a public forum... Well my voice is my power. Freedom of speech. Freedom of opinion. Freedom of dreams\nIm not crazy Im free\nNo slave mindset no more. Im free. Im free. Im free\nI wrote Saint Pablo after admitting to my greatest shame my personal debt. But Im not ashamed anymore\nIm proud as an entrepreneur that I gave everything I had to my dreams\nIm happy and free and proud and confident. Im not crazy. Im free\nFree from being held back by public opinion\nIts a beautiful time. I love my friends. I love my family. I love people. The human race\nYou guys will see my heart. You guys will feel my heart. We will make a difference\nI just had to start with shoes so that I could be economically empowered enough to have a voice\nWhat is your definition of true freedom? There is no true freedom without economic freedom\nRespect to everyone working hard to keep a roof over their kids\nThat is one of the reasons I respect the paps so much\nAnd yes Ive talked to Adidas and we gon hook yall up with free Yeezys and Adidas. All positive vibes\nIm not even gon lie to you.

"So after walking through here I decided that I wanted to make sure for anyone that didn’t have tickets tonight that you all could have tickets to the show. So anybody who wants to come tonight, you can have tickets for the entire office!\nBut I just wanted to tell you guys: I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be “architected.” And this is the reason why even some of the first DONDA employees were architects that started designing t-shirts instead of buildings. But just to see the work actually be actualized\nIf I sit down and talk to Oprah for 2 hours, the conversation is about realization, self realization, and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you. So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews is because I’ve tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive way\nAnd I know that there’s more creativity to happen. And I know that there’s traditionalists that hold back the good thoughts and there’s people in offices that stop the creative people, and are intimidated by actual good ideas\nI believe that utopia is actually possible—but we’re led by the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political. So in no way am I a politician—I’m usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct. I really appreciate you guys’ willingness to learn and hone your craft, and not be lazy about creation\nI’m very inspired to be in this space. Tonight, this show, if you come see it—um, I’m a bit self conscious because I’m showing it to architects. So the stage does have flaws in it. It’s an expression of emotion so give me a pass on that. And that’s basically all I have to say so thank you very much",

"What is going on and its Michelle LAs 97-01 radio is what youre listening to. First thing I walk in the door and right behind me here he is Kanye West\nWhat up\nHow are you?\nIm awesome\nI know youre doing a ton of interviews right now, this is the first time youve been to Amp radio, so I have to say thank you\nOkay, awesome\nThis is pretty major and, I dont know, you probably have no way of knowing this, but the very first song I ever played on amp radio, about four years ago, was \"Paranoid\"\nWell thank you very much\nAbsolutely were huge fans around here\nThank you, I appreciate that\nThanks for coming in. So whats the story behind all of a sudden were seeing you in front of us? Because you havent done a whole lot of these kinds of interviews but now here you are, so were thrilled to have you here. You just feel like going out and saying hello?\nYeah, thats it\nThats awesome. I dig that. So youre out on the Yeezus tour right now which, first, your album is awesome. The live show sold out at Staples on Saturday night, you got another one and then youve got Anaheim on Friday, so tell me a little bit about what to expect at the tour stops, because like I just told you before we went on the air, I saw a little bit of the clips but I feel like it doesnt do it the justice of actually being there and experiencing the show in the moment\nYeah even if I explain it...you know its just like creativity central. Its an example of like what DONDA can do - thats my creative company - its an example of what happens when you put amazing thinkers in a room together and eliminate what they normally do and all the cliches that people slip into and challenge everyone in that room to come up with something completely new, and thats what is, completely new. You know we we experiment with things, and they get better, and its going to get better as it goes, but if I have an idea, I just do it. I just go for it\nYeah thats cool, theres a certain fearlessness about you which I really dig. Do you feel like you get crap for that a little bit? The people misunderstand you?\nYeah Im not fearless, I just have courage, bravery. Like I have fear, but I overcome my fear. I know how to swim through backlash. I know how to float, I can tread water through backlash. I dont care about backlash if anything, because its all given me power. Negative, positive, its all energy and I can use energy\nWhat really inspires you? I know youre really creative in so many different arenas but what do you look for, what would spark you?\nGod. Number one inspiration, God. How can you get something to the you know the greatest. Hes the greatest creator of all time, so - if youre being creative - my greatest inspiration is God. He made our universe you know ? So you look that far and say, \"if you gotta push hard to create on a more major scale,\" nothing is more major then the creator. Hes given us the power of free will and the ability to create our own space, right\nSometimes people say like, \"it seems like youre not satisfied with just creating music,\" well look at what Howard Hughes did, look what David Stern did, look what Steve Jobs did, look what Da Vinci did, look what Michelangelo did. I have this platform now at age 36 to really put out a lot a creative ideas. Certain people who are not giving me a shot or not backing me, and I can meet with all the billionaires in the world and people just look at me like its not me, like I havent created what Ive created\nSo I had to apologize to all the guys in the world for my engagement because I turned up so much on it, but when you go on Jimmy Kimmel and say, \"hey Im a creative genius,\" I dont think people really understood what I was talking about. So let me make it so yall can understand what Im talking about when I say \"creative genius\" because thats my title\nDo you think youre misunderstood in that aspect? Do you think people just take things the wrong way?\nThey just never heard it before. They never tasted that flavor yet\nI just think its awesome because you have a certain thing about you that you say whats on your mind and your true to yourself and I think a lot of people dont know what to do with that because theyre not.\nYeah and thats what is. If I say, \"hey Im a creative genius,\" I dont know any other way to explain what I do and the way I think up things and the way I have to fight to get ideas out, had to fight to get my record deal, Im fighting to be able to make clothes, Im fighting to be able to make films. Its mixing creativity with the fight, like an athlete.\nIts okay for athletes to fight and push it, but they want the creative people to shut up and be quiet. These are the people with the real ideas, that can actually change, can reorganize, can design cities, can restructure a curriculum, can can make life easier you know. Thats the part of the game I wanna be in, the \"making life more awesome\" because Im so blessed.\nIve had so many of my dreams come true. Im getting married to my dream girl, I have a family, I have good friends around me, Ive had some opportunities and what I realized is my greatest power...so, if you asked me a question before, \"why am I coming, why am I speaking,\" Im not a billionaire. I may not be the richest person on the planet, I might not be the most attractive guy, I might not be the most liked, but I - right now - because of \"New Slaves\" and because of the position Ive always taken, have the most powerful voice by a mile and Im going to use that. I have a trillion dollars worth of voice.\nAnd thats very very valuable. So youre talking about youre influences, with God and family and your life and enjoying life and, I was thinking just how much your life has changed even in the past six months to a year and how much has that changed your daily . Does that mellow you out? Change your perspective on things?\nI hang out wit my the girl and my daughter everyday. Theres no place Id rather be, so now even when I was thinking about the things Im creating or the things Im doing in business, my biggest goal is to be able to get home to my family. So even, as Im thinking about things Im doing for the future, its like how can I set it up so I can just be my daughters soccer coach. How can I put myself in that position?\nI cant imagine you showing up at the soccer game, I just think that would be awesome.\nIm going to be a soccer coach. Like, Im going to design the uniforms, Im going to have to redesigned the minivan maybe . Maybe me and Elon Musk can design a new type of minivan.\nA new Kanye West mini van. See thats a partnership you could get on board with right there.\nWell DONDA, we want to create everything. We have a perspective on things you see, touch, taste, and feel, just the quality of life. We want to improve the quality of life. It is a product, experience, and content company. So, a form of content could be Yeezus. That is a form of content. Experience could be the concert you went to. A product could be the Yeezys. Those are examples of things that a collective of creative people have put together\nOne thing I also want to stress is that the most genius thing about the way I create is to create with other geniuses. To get out of their way. Its not a matter of ego related to any ideas. Its just, who has the best idea? We, actually, are really not ego based in any way. These are things that people put up to confuse you or distract you from what it actually is. At this point its Michael Jordan time, its time to go six championships in and let people know this is what were doing. Were creating at the highest level. I might not be the number one rockstar, but I will be and create the number one creative company. The post internet Disney. The post internet Ralph Lauren",

"Bro. Bro. Listen to the kids. Jeremy, I need, I gotta put it down for a second. It’s beautiful. Jeremy Scotts design.\nFirst of all, thank you Taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award, this evening thank you. And I can think back to the first day I met you, also. You know. I think about, when I’m in the grocery store with my daughter, and I have a really great conversation about fresh juice and, you know. And at the end they say, \"Oh, you’re not that bad after all.\" And like, I think about it sometimes. Like, it crosses my mind a bit like when I go to a baseball game. And um, sixty thousand people boo me. Crosses my mind a little bit. And I think if I had to do it all again what would I have done?\nWould I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank a half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience Y’all know y’all drink that bottle too. If I had a daughter at that time, would I have went on stage and grab the mic from someone elses? You know, this arena tomorrow, it’s gonna be a completely different set up, some concert something like that. This stage will be gone, after that night, the stage is gone, but the effect that it had on people remain.\nThe, the problem was, the contradiction, the contradiction is, I do fight for artists, but in that fight I somehow, was disrespectful to artists. I-I didn’t know how to say the right thing. The perfect thing. I just, I sat at the Grammy’s and saw Justin Timberlake and Cee-Lo lose. Gnarls Barkley and the Future-Love... \"SexyBack\" album, and bro….Justin I ain’t tryna put you on blast but I saw that man in tears, bro. You know, and I was thinking like, \"He deserve to win Album of the Year.\"\nAnd this small box that we are as the entertainers of the evening. How could you explain that? Sometimes I feel like, you know, all this shit they run about beef and that, sometimes I feel like I died for an artists opinion, for an artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful. I’m not no politician bro. And look at that, you know how many times MTV ran that footage again, cause it got them more ratings? You know how many times they announced Taylor was gonna give me the award, cause it got them more ratings? Listen to the kids bro!\nI still don’t understand award shows, I don’t understand how they get five people who work their entire life, won, sold records, sold concert tickets, to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser. I don’t understand it bro. I don’t understand when the biggest album or the biggest video, I still don’t understand it, I been conflicted bro, I just wanted people to like me more. But fuck that bro!\nTwo thousand and fifteen. I will die for the art for what I believe in and the art aint always gonna be polite. Y’all might be thinking right now, I wonder, did he smoke something before he came up here? The answer is yes, I rolled up a little something, I knocked the edge off. I don’t know what’s gonna happen tonight, I don’t know whats going to happen tomorrow bro.\nBut all I can say to my artists, my fellow artists, just worry how you feel at the time man, just worry about how you feel and don’t never, you know what I’m saying, I’m confident, I believe in myself. We the millennials bro, this is a new, this is a new mentality. We not gonna control our kids with brands. We’re not gonna teach low self-esteem and hate to our kids, we’re gonna teach our kids that they can be something. We gonna teach our kids that they can stand up for themselves. We gonna teach our kids to believe in themselves. If my grandfather was here right now, he would not let me back down.\nI don’t know what I’m finna lose after this. It don’t matter though, it ain’t about me, it’s about ideas. People with new ideas. People who believe in truth.\nAnd yes, as you probably could have guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020, to run for President.",

Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you. Radio, fuck you! I know it’s a lot of real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over. And when I say that bullshit, what I’m saying is: we love Drake, Drake is great. He’s a great artist. But Frank Ocean is great, too! But you know who the greatest of all of us? Who do y’all think?\nNope. Kid motherfucking Cudi.\nRadio, fuck you! Oh yeah, I’m on my Trump shit tonight. Radio, fuck you. Yeah, I’m taking his lead. I’ma just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win. I’ma take his lead. Radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Wait a second. Aye, is it, “Radio, fuck you? That’s what you’re saying?” Exactly.\nNot fuck the people that work at radio because these is real people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to play that real shit because they think that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same shit over and over and over. I was raised by KRS 1, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was raised by DMX. The last real nigga alive? Naw, nigga! We real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh! We alive tonight, bruh! Virgil Abloh is alive tonight, bro! A$AP Nast is alive tonight, bro! Bari is alive tonight, bro! Ian Connor is alive tonight, bro! Rocky alive tonight, bro! Aye, y’all love my show. When I say these names, y’all better scream for me. I don’t give a fuck if you know the names or not! Go ahead, Google them. They will give you a little bit of factual information. They will give you that. Why did I name A$AP? Because that’s the future. That’s the niggas, they got me and Cudi. It’s life.\nWe’ve got a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this planet, bro, and we can have a utopia! We can love each other! But the rules gotta be fair. Khaled and Drake and radio and Doc and 92.3 and everybody; is it just me, or did you hear that song so many times “you say you wanna play for free?” Aye, aye! You know what it is, though? Because, aye, I love Drake, I love Khaled. But they set that song up, bro!\nAnd let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you! Once again, as always! I’m on my Trump shit tonight! Let me tell you what it is, bruh. Aye, you know me. I went down seven years of my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best video. Hey, baby, let’s rock and roll tonight. Y’all might be experiencing a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back! The prodigal son, Kid Cudi, has returned! The vibes is back! I know it’s going to be a lot of conversations after tonight!\nKhaled, I know you got hitters from Miami. Please do not send them at my head. I just want to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga! You got the keys! But, as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing for years, Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this - AAAH! - and still win! He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro. Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro!\nSo, when I talk about MTV, let me explain something: I was hurt. Beyoncé, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I don’t expect MTV to help me. Mr. West, I don’t respect you. I will let you know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.” They told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage. Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision and you know I’ma gonna keep it real with you. Beyoncé, I was hurt! I went down seven years on behalf of your —hey, nigga, don’t throw no shit while I’m talking! I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I talk to y’all like this! This is a moment in the matrix, bro! The vibes is back! The vibes is back! Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight.\nBeyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over \"Hotline Bling.\" In my opinion — now, don’t go trying to diss Beyoncé. She is great, Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal!\nBut sometimes, we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh! I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I’ve been sitting here to give y’all the truth.\nJay Z, call me, bruh! You still ain’t calling me! Jay Z, call me! Aye, bruh, I know you got killers, please don’t send them at my head! Just call me! Talk to me like a man! I’m not trying to be the man, I just am a man, the same as anybody here! I ain’t above, below none of y’all. We all equal! We all equal! This is the vibes, bro! This is the future. This is the way of thinking to make America great again! Haha, you didn’t like that! Guess what? Y’all need the vibes! I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro! The way motherfuckers put money up so high, popularity, radio spins. Feelings matter, bro. Feelings matter, bro.\nIt’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world! Feelings matter! Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro. It’s a new world. It’s a new world, Barack! It’s a new world, Jay Z! Hey, don’t send killers at my head, bro! This ain’t the Malcolm X movie. We growing from that moment. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye. And wait a second, do y’all agree with that? Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye! Wait a second, I ain’t hear enough screams on that. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye!\nPeople, I’m not saying this out of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of my own well-being to say things like this. Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of motherfucking times. Y’all motherfuckers is behind the times! Because guess what? The Saint Pablo Tour is the most relevant shit happening! The Saint Pablo Tour is more relevant than radio! And if y’all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clinton! You might not like it, but they gotta hear it. I ain’t here to massage you with a fake truth, telling you that Hillary gon’ win over and over and over and then you wake up, you still can’t believe it! You know why? Because you was lied to by Google. You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg!\nMark Zuckerberg, you wanna call me now?! Do I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?! Was you wrong? When I said I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, was you wrong? You ate dinner, you asked my friend Ebony Schiller to have dinner with me. I told you about DONDA. You said you would help and you didn’t! Then you went to look for aliens. Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro! The vibes is back!\n Aye, John, take it all the way back to the beginning.\nShia LaBeouf, Kid Cudi feels a way. Give him a call.\nQ-Tip, I love you, bro. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I love you. The Tribe album is dope. I love you. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I’ve been me, I am me. There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the power. That’s happened with musicians because they’re scared. I’m not scared! I’m here to change things! I am here to change things. And things won’t change until people admit their own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That’s what I’ve been blessed with. My vision! I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I’m going to say how I feel. Right now, press, get ready to write your passive-aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season 4, racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press! Get ready, get ready!

"Zane Lowe: Nice to see you again man. Thanks for stopping by the BBC for a chat\nKanye West: Good to see you too sir. Thank you\nZane Lowe: So, I was thinking today like where do we begin? Because you’ve been having some remarkable conversations lately, some really in depth, really interesting conversations addressing recent things that have gone on, you know, successes, things that have kind of made people think, talk amongst themselves and it got me thinking like, where were we last time. We were 18 months ago, not far from here and so much has changed in the last 18 months. The first question I wanted to ask you, cause I’ve always wondered how you felt at that time\nKanye West: I had so many interviews where I’m trying to express that I can create, that I can create outside of just the music box and I’m giving examples of work that I did that was really successful and I’m getting just completely shut down. But not just by the company we talked about last time but every single company, every single company you could imagine is just like “no, you are celebrity. You are not allowed to create, you’re not allowed to think, you’re not allowed to have an opinion. You’re just here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.” And it’s true that as a celebrity you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to allow me to think or be involved in the product and you know, as I told you last time I said I’m a product guy\nZane Lowe: Yea, and it was an electrifying conservation, and I mean, it felt like you were taking names that day, it felt like you were also trying to reach people that day and what’s occurred since you know is you have made serious moves into that world. You know, what’s happened recently with Yeezy supply, you know your deal with Adidas, how has that experience been overall for you now with product out and with peoples opinion about the shoes and about what they’ve seen -- how has that experience been for you? How can you put that into context for us?\nKanye West: I mean, every day when you go to the gym or you go to work it’s a challenge. You gotta work hard and you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what. So that’s the way I’mma word it. You know what I’m saying, so we made it to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the level of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a company that was flexible enough and had been used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that was very close to my heart. You know, they original hip hop\nZane Lowe: Of course, Run DMC man I mean they were right there at the very beginning it was kind of a perfect partnership when it was announced, you know, not long after and I wondered when did the conversation actually begin with Adidias after you starting talking about your aspirations and what you wanted to achieve in that industry?\nKanye West: That conversation had already started before then. There was a few conversations with a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, it was a certain point where I just felt like I couldn’t breathe anymore like I had all these ideas and I felt like I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know like we have this idea of a mass market looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something. And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no amount of money that can be given to them to make them not want to or have to create. There’s no check out and there’s no cheque to stop you from creative. No pun intended when I’m saying no check\nZane Lowe: Was a good one though\nKanye West: Just even thinking about it takes the breath out of me because I mean, as soon as we got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were so many ideas. I mean I look at over 500 images a day on my laptop. And I remember I went into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s like wait a second, dude, like I been fighting this battle for a long time, since like Universe City. Like no one has any idea what the meeting were like. I’mma throw this one out here. I remember this one guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Kering Group came up in my apartment in Paris, while I was working on Yeezus and I had a meeting with him and it was related to doing a deal with Puma. And the guy, actually I forgot about the meeting right, so I had my jacket on and it was a jacket I had done with A.P.C. and I was about to leave, so he shows up at the door and we go to my dining room table and I’m sitting with him, and I tell him like yo I made this jacket. And he makes some joke about, you know “You did look pretty hot. I’m happy to know that you put on all those clothes for me.”\nZane Lowe: Was he joking do you think?\nKanye West: He was leveling. He was leveling the conversation, this is what people do all the time. Like if I meet someone who I respect or I look up to, I will literally like kiss their feet. You know someone that I know that’s put in a lot of work. And it’s a lot of agents, a lot of people who work under the main guy that will level, that will try to level you. You know when they talk to you, they talk down to you. And I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.” Obviously I have to show him like hey I’m working on this stuff and it’s coming out good and this is all I have a chance to work on. You know like when I worked with A.P.C. I only had two times to look at the collection, you know I couldn’t really grab it and dig into it the way I dig into like working on “All Of The Lights” or something like that, it’s like, there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re dealing with apparel and the way that people make apparel currently\nZane Lowe: I can imagine the frustration for you at that moment in time as you’re leading up to what has effectively occurred in the last year. Seeing something like you say, close to the vision you have in your mind. At those early stages, man the frustration of trying to get those ideas out and just like you said, and getting just levelled\nKanye West: Everyone, everyone I talked to would try to level me. You know. And then there was this guy named Hermann Deininger that was the head of Adidas. And I say “was” because he passed away recently. And I showed him what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was using 7 screens, the surround vision idea which we’ve never shown online because you have to experience it in it’s space. It’s the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you know this is the new frontier on the way we need to see film. And which I got all no’s on that – to date. And this guy Hermann saw it, and he believed. He believed that maybe I had something more than how big my rap record was. In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this guy has something to say and to give that’s past the current box that he’s put in. And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done. And the deal has nothing to do with the idea of the higher ups in society. The deal is all about the moment when I can bring a shoe to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my knees and take it back to when I worked at The Gap and put the shoes on his feet. That is what the deal is about. The deal is about when the star of a show is a 5 foot 3 girl, when there’s never been a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of any fashion show. The deal is when the kids came to 42 locations across the world to see Yeezy Season 1 x Adidas Originals launch and the excitement that was in that theater, and when they saw that line up, they saw that brigade, they reacted to it when they heard “Wolves,\" when they saw the boots, when they saw the runners, when they saw the matrix sweaters, when they saw all these things like hitting them back to back to back to back. This is what I fought for. None of this was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini. It, like, it wasnt about that. It was about these kids having a moment. To be themselves. To be a stronger version, you know, of themselves. I make this stuff to empower people. I feel like theres so many things that are made to, you know, to wear the people as opposed to people wearing it. And I asked my assistant one time. I was like, \"how does these clothes make you feel?\" She said, \"I feel powerful.\" And thats our, thats our main goal. As the song says, \"no one man should have all that power.\" No one man should have it. Everyone should have it\nZane Lowe: You seem to be totally, well, a lot more aware of what it is that.. well, in a much, sort of like a more focused way youre able to know where you wanna be and what impact you wanna have. And it feels like youre very attached to the well-being of the people and what they can get out of this. You know, and across the border. And when that moment kind of occurred to you. Cause that doesnt happen overnight, you know.. theres.. but it does lead up to that. And 18 months ago you were fighting, you know, you were like really fighting to be heard. And now it seems to me like youre very consciously aware\nKanye West: Yeah, I was still off, you know what I mean? I might have some things that are off now, but I feel like, in the same way when I came up with \"All Falls Down,\" and I was able to differentiate myself from whoever I was trying to rap like at that point and I found my voice and my message. Its like, I felt like..\nZane Lowe: That was the moment you felt like that was, yeah..\nKanye West: When I wrote \"All Falls Down.\" Thats when I was like, \"okay, this is who I am in the.. this is what Im, this is what Im presenting.\" So now I feel like.. its funny, I would always say, you know, \"I wanna sculpt with marble.\" And it wasnt until I was working on Yeezus, and I was learning about furniture and the fact that I am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to go to French flea markets and the galleries and buy, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot for. And one of the things they had was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was made of cement, and it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he made it for Zeus, so he made it for everyone. And it was made of cement. So it wasnt the material, it was the idea that was the most important. And I always wanted the resources of LVMH, but it wasnt until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color and finishing and applying it to fleece and jersey French terry which is a cement in comparison to, you know, the type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use. That I find a message, a voice, a reason, a reason to create. You know, it was a futile argument for me to say, \"hey, everyone, get behind me so I can make another $5000 jacket that you can afford.\" Its like insane. But now I feel people rallying because they know that I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I know that Adidas can eventually get those price points. And I want to apologize to everyone right now because I believe that Season 1 may still be in that upper price point and theres still the words \"exclusivity,\" you know, being thrown around. \"Exclusivity\" is the new N-word. Not nigga, \"exclusivity.\" Am I saying the word right?\nZane Lowe: Yeah\nKanye West: Yeah, that is the new N-word. Cause nothing should be exclusive. Everyone should have the opportunity to drink from the same fountain. The idea of exclusivity is a new colored-people fountain concept. And saying, \"were gonna overcharge sneaker culture guys to, you know, drink at the right fountain.\" You know, we have to reboot our mentality. Period. Of a generation. You know, it wouldnt even matter if I sold one sweatshirt. You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids hear this and know this and or someone in position of power or someone that will be in a position of power in the future has a chance to make a difference. And they say someone who was at the lowest point grabbing at straws, express themselves freely, and overcame it through all adversary, all adversity, means that they can do the same thing. You know\nZane Lowe: Yeah. Because the thing is when people hear you talking at times I think that theres a genuine consensus from those cause believe me, youre compelling to a lot of people. And, you know, what you say is.. I think you have very unique views on things that should be heard. But some people I think have thought overtime that.. theyve obviously missed the point. Theyve thought that you bringing it back to you. But youre actually trying to open up to everybody else. Youre trying to break down that barrier of exclusivity and say you know.. If you have to lead the way you have to lead the way. It might not end with you, but maybe if it starts with you is your point\nKanye West: And I was, I was using the wrong words. My rap was wrong. You know what Im saying? I was getting the drinks, you know, thrown in my face as opposed to leaving with the girl at the end of the night. You know, cause imagine, think about the type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews. And imagine if someone said this very thing to a girl at a bar. \"Yo, what up, baby? Im a genius!\" They be like, \"yo, whos this guy?\" \"No, Im telling you, I sold all this, I sold this many shoes.\" Then she be like, \"yo, chill, chill.\" Like, \"gosh, get me out of here already.\" You know what Im saying? And thats who I was and that was that frustration I had cause Im seeing like this.. Im looking at this girl like, \"man, I know that..\"\nZane Lowe: \"We could be good together, this could work.\"\nKanye West: Yeah, I know, I just dont know how to work it\nZane Lowe: So Im messing it up, yeah\nKanye West: And the right way so Im gonna stumble. I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with like corporations and stuff you know..\nZane Lowe: Youre the 40 year old virgin of dealing with corporations?\nKanye West: Yeah. I did not know how to communicate at all. And its like I had my point, my message was, you know, simply like, \"your egg, my semen, we change the world.\" You know, and I imagine that thats gonna sound wrong\nZane Lowe: Thats a hell of a pick up line, man\nKanye West: I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, because wrong is okay, you know like..\nZane Lowe: Its okay, its okay, wrong..\nKanye West: We have the right to be wrong sometimes\nZane Lowe: Thats a great line. You know I wanted to talk to you.. when we started talking, you know, a while back, music was on my agenda because, you know, I mean, we talked a couple times before as well. And you know Im a music guy, I mean, it really drives me, and its a big part of my life. And over the course of this conversation, you know, I wanna ask you at some point what the future looks like and feels like to you cause Im fascinated in the certain things I wanna touch on, but I do want to talk about your forthcoming, new record if thats cool. Do you want to talk about music?\nKanye West: Yeah\nZane Lowe: Cause to me it feels like over the course of that frustration last time you had to make sacrifices to be heard and it felt like you didnt really wanna talk about Yezus. You were like, \"thats cool and everything, but I wanna talk about this.\" And lately, I just, maybe Im, I feel like youre really energized with music in a big way\nKanye West: You know, after I did the presentation in New York I was able to get that alien out of my stomach, you know like. I was on a flight back in the morning to go shoot the \"Blessings\" video with Big Sean and Drake\nZane Lowe: Yeah\nKanye West: And I couldnt have been happier. To go and shoot this video with two of the hottest rappers in the game. Well, lets be respectful and truthful. The hottest rapper and one of the hottest rappers in the game. And I fall somewhere in that, you know? In that, that field. So..\nZane Lowe: Getting back to music for a minute, I feel like were right back, I gotta bring you right back for a second. I want to know what we can look forward to on this record. You talked about cookout music, you talked about what this album represents. And every record you have made has been something new and fresh. Youve taken yourself and your craft to a new place. Wheres your head at right now with this new album?\nKanye West: Just working hard. On it\nZane Lowe: And its fun?\nKanye West: And its fun. And its fun to work hard and were being inventive and Ive still got some, you know, a lot of opinions and perspectives that I think are important and very.. can be inspiring to people. That fight, and you know, The College Dropout came out of a fight to want to rap. And this new album is coming out of a fight of wanting to design. And..\nZane Lowe: I wondered about that, cause Yeezus was punk-rock to me. That was like, that was Sex Pistols to me. That was like Public Enemy to me. That was one of the records that stands as establishing an industrial, strong statement. And I wondered like where the desire is coming from on this record. And without giving away too much cause the proof is in the hearing, the joy is in the hearing. Where its coming from\nKanye West: I mean, its a joyful noise onto the Lord. Like, it is still, you know, the struggle, you know, but the beauty from the struggle. You know\nZane Lowe: As opposed to just the struggle?\nKanye West: Yea, the song Amazing Grace, you know coming out of the worst pain possible and making the most beautiful song you know, possible. You know I wanna perform “Only One” as many times as possible. You know could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I said I didn’t come here to be liked I came here to make a difference. I’m not talking about this interview, I’m talking about life. Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I think I could figure that out. I think I’m way nicer to people just in general. Everyone I meet I’m extremely nice. But as soon as people start playing games I stop. I stop playing games. And at any moment I can hit that Ye button and we can go right back to day one. People be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick. But it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy. I like the, I like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I come in I have all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and that happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though! How bout we make a song?” And we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song\nZane Lowe: He is the most, cause I’ve met him many times now and he is just so tapped into the joy of making music. And he so gets it in the sense that it’s like kinda let it lead you. Let the song sorta lead you to where it needs to go is the vibe I get from him like yea, let’s just see where this goes\nKanye West: And yea that’s what we did. You know people think that our first two singles don’t have drums but both of those are percussive instruments\nZane Lowe: Yea totally that’s what he’s doing. That’s like “dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun” that’s what it is. S I just wanna talk about working with him because I haven’t actually seen too many people focus on that which surprises me, maybe I’m wrong, but I just, I love the idea of that collaboration occurring and it’s a natural one. Certainly on “FourFiveSeconds” I think that’s one of Rihanna’s greatest vocal performances period\nKanye West: She was killing that right?\nZane Lowe: My gosh man. I mean that’s like a whole other attitude that I haven’t heard from her as a star. She’s really gone inside that record and wrangled it. How was it making that and getting that song out cause it feels effortless to listen to, it almost has like a 70’s FM American rock, sort of country-rock radio vibe to it, you know what I mean, like something you would’ve heard in Los Angeles in ’76 or something\nKanye West: I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I was growing up. And I mean the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t need to understand them, and to be able to be involved with that..\nZane Lowe: It’s because he invented them\nKanye West: Yea exactly. And be able to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney is like meeting Ralph Lauren\nZane Lowe: Yea, totally!\nKanye West: It’s like “whoa!”\nZane Lowe: Dude he’s the greatest\nKanye West: The greatest of their field, period. Of all time\nZane Lowe: And you got to say “wildin’” in a song with him it’s just incredible cause it’s still hip hop, that’s what’s amazing about it\nKanye West: Yea the whole cadence was trap. Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trap\nZane Lowe: That’s again is the fusion of cultures which I love. It’s what did you call it before when you when you were talking about Sean wearing and your shoes – you were saying, it’s -- I can’t remember what you said\nKanye West: Fusion is the future. Period. The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the two lunch tables working together, you know. Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like incorrect English – I’m sorry mom – but you know I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know the greatest fashion instructor of all time. And I’m talking about of all timers.\nZane Lowe: Educate us man, tell us\nKanye West: Ok so Louise Wilson was the baddest professor of all time of any fashion school, ever. Notorious for not letting people stop at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a 12. So the first time that I saw one of her students Pheobe Philos Céline collection, I was looking at a 12. When I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was looking at a 12. Christopher Kanes Bandage collection I’m looking at a 12. Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a 12. That’s the designer, the designer of Lanvin which completely revolutionized the men’s sneaker, fashion sneaker industry. Last time I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is my favourite restaurant in London and I think she knew that she was gonna pass and she just wanted to give me some words of advice moving forward and she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about my wife. And she said so many students, they don’t give it their all. And the problem is soon as they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, 3 years old, their parents clap\nZane Lowe: \nKanye West: Exactly, that’s what she said, they clap. And she just looked at me, she said “Kanye, don’t clap.”\nZane Lowe: Aww, what, that’s just! How you getting on with that?\nKanye West: I didn’t know we were gonna lose her. You know I just um, and she told me she said, you know “thank you for the times you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot to me.” You know she would—\nZane Lowe Wanna take a minute? We’ll take a minute. Let’s take a minute\nKanye West: That’s never happened to me in an interview before\nZane Lowe: You ok?\nKanye West: Yea, I’m ok, I think I’m ok\nZane Lowe: We’re gonna change the subject. Here we go. One of the things you said recently which really kinda made me think was you know you really truly believe that you’re gonna be the head of the world’s first trillion dollar company and the first thing that sprang to my mind Kanye was what is that company going to look like?\nKanye West: Johnny Ive who is like, in my opinion from what I know, Elon Musk included, is like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best mentality behind design. And I said from what I know because there might be other, there might be some others, there are a lot that are great but Johnny Ives the best that I know. He said that people are so concerned at being first as opposed to being better so I think that, I think innovation almost gets too much credit, in a way. So, if we talk about this type of company, it wouldn’t be a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the innovation.”\nZane Lowe: Yea, and he’s got a point\nKanye West: The money’s in the repetition, you know so..\nZane Lowe: It’s in the quality\nKanye West: And making something of better quality for more people. So it has to be a balance of both. I’ve said this a few times but I wanna just say it right here for people who haven’t read it or seen but I think people think that I pander to fashion particularly. You know because, people say “why fashion?” It’s not politics, world war it’s not that, it’s fashion, it’s just a jacket or something, it’s just a dress. But I believe that the world can only be saved through design. And I think that the fashion world has.. and when I say through design, I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “Kanye West said that the world will be saved with a couture dress.” That’s not what I’m saying. The mentality behind design, you know art is to be free. Design is to fix\nZane Lowe: This is important, you’re talking about the actual, like you say the mentality, the purpose behind it, what it means behind the actual product\nKanye West: No politics, just truth. Does it fucking work or not. Irrigation, you know, that’s a form of design\nZane Lowe: What are those conversations like, because you, one of the great privileges that you’re in because you know you push yourself is that you get to find yourself in rooms with people that push themselves. So that conversations can be pushed. And I wonder what those conversations are like because I’m fascinated by somebody like Elon Musk and his absolute inability to be restrained by boundary. And you are very much cut from that same cloth. What is it like when you guys get together and do you talk about things as kind of obvious or as what the future will feel like or is it more casual than that?\nKanye West: That’s exactly what we talk about. What does Kanye West and Elon Musk talk about? The fut’\nZane Lowe: The fut’ -- TM\nKanye West: So when I put out things that if I say hey, I want to work with Miucca Prada one day on highschool uniforms or something, I just put it out, you know. We just put it out there. Or as I told Obama last time I saw him, hey, I want, I would suggest that you sit with Elon Musk. I would suggest that both you guys go to China. I would suggest this. The, I think it may happen\nZane Lowe: Must be amazing, those conversations man must be amazing\nKanye West: I got scared of the idea you know someone call you crazy so many times you start to believe it. And I almost got scared of the idea of like going crazy in some way but I wasn’t going crazy, I was like the only person that wasn’t crazy. You know what I’m saying like, I just stand there and I just look like “is anyone else here seeing what I’m seeing? None of you guys are seeing what I’m seeing” or it’s just like your Maybach and your house is like that important that you won’t move at all\nZane Lowe: It’s distractions\nKanye West: That you won’t say anything at all in risk of losing something. You won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point? You know so, if you have that ability to do that, to see that, you know that Walt Disney ability in some way, you have to apply it. You have to use it. You can’t be psyched out. You know, everyone’s on our side. I was just in my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything that I ever said will happen, will happen. Just as much as you guys saw that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you saw that front row. The juxtaposition of the people in the front and second rows to where the people standing in the show had come from is the fusion and is the future. It is the glass shattering of the class system, which is the new racism. Class is the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people in a place based on where their kids go to school, how much money they make, what they drive, where they live and what type of clothes they have and how much, you know, how much they have in their account for their retirement. To somehow say that this person right here means more than this person. Like I know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter. Like, my doorman is more important to me than any head of any company. He keeps us safe. My driver, keeps us safe and goes to work every day. The guy painting the windows at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know what the architect suggested, he is just as important as anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne. It’s no more of this separation of what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty. Whatever it is that people use to separate people\nZane Lowe: But was that moment, which I didn’t want to talk about but you raised it and I want to actually bring this up because you have to learn from experience. You can’t have all those answers straight away, you have to make those mistakes yourself I think in order to come to that level of clarity\nKanye West: And I’m not saying I have answers, I’m just saying these are my current opinions. As I gave my current opinions a year ago, this is my current opinions now\nZane Lowe: Sure, sure, and that’s great, that’s what we want, that’s why I’m asking questions so we get to hear your answers. But when you, I think… Cause you know I was nominated for that Album Of The Year as well as part of the Sam Smith album as a producer and a co-writer\nKanye West: Oh, oh wow\nZane Lowe: Right, so I was at the awards ceremony with the other producers and co-writers that are part of each records. And, like I’m a huge fan of all the nominees that were nominated and I’m a huge fan of Beck and it’s funny that you say, you talk about everyone you want to get it to a place where people can exist in their own terms and that leaves it open for fusion. But then like you say you can just push a button and be back and be old Ye, you know old Yeezy. Is that what happened that night? Just “gaaah, I can’t take it I’ve gotta get up on this stage, I’ve gotta wild out.” Cause we all thought you were joking. You know what I thought was brilliant about that night? When you did it on the night, I was applauding because I was like, “that was Sun Tzu, that was Art of War.” He waited for the right platform, went up, pretended to do it, walked back down everyone’s like “aww, so funny” I was like “he just got the last laugh on this.” And then I woke up the next morning and it was like “naw, he’s not an artist” and I was like “aw man, I love that album!”\nKanye West: Yea, I never said that he’s not an artist\nZane Lowe: Ok, I’m misquoting you. But you were talking about artistry. And do you learn form those lessons yourself? Is that when you kind of get a little bit closer to understanding what you believe is really important? When you do things like and think, well maybe I did kinda misconstrue that\nKanye West: I think yea I misconstrued it but I think that everybody has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be wrong. You know, there could be a lot of people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball. But there’s a bunch of Patriots fans that are happy he didn’t get the ball. And everyone has a right to their opinion. You know, and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the weight of it\nZane Lowe: He’s great though. You know, he is great though. There’s three..\nKanye West: Naw you know as I said on the Charlamagne interview when I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I was like “this is really good… maybe I might’ve been wrong!” You know like, and uh..\nZane Lowe: It’s a great album man\nKanye West: And I hadn’t been in like 6 years. And the Grammy’s are definitely like an ex-girlfriend. Soon as you get in a car with them, you wanna go right back home\nZane Lowe: So we’re gonna get a record this year, and I’m excited to hear it, I really am excited to hear it, and as we draw closer to the end of this particular talk I want to do it once again bring it back to like, the thing that really --\nKanye West: only one thing I want to say, people say I’m a hypocrite right?\nZane Lowe: Some\nKanye West: People say that right?\nZane Lowe: Some\nKanye West: Yes, I am. 100%. I’m a human being. I’m super hypocritical. I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time. I do it in the design office. I do it in the studio. I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do it when I get dressed. “I love this” “I hate this!”\nZane Lowe: How long does it take you to get dressed on a daily basis?\nKanye West: 3 minutes. 2 minutes. Bars\nZane Lowe: How long does it take your wife to get dressed every day?\nKanye West: Sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes longer. I mean she’s a woman\nZane Lowe: Course. You know it seems that um, you know what I love about “Only One” is the interaction and the way that you’ve been able to create different generations of your life and of your family communicating with one another, through one another, as a portal. And I love that. And I think it’s one of those songs that successfully does that. And um, I’m a father, you’re a father, it’s the greatest thing of all time. No question about it, it is the great level of all time, it’s the greatest thing of all time. And, you know your daughter is what, 18 months now? 18 months old? You an only child?\nKanye West: Yes\nZane Lowe: Do you think about giving her brothers and sisters? Do you think about your upbringing and what you went through and how you feel in this life and what it means to have siblings?\nKanye West: Oh, I’m practicing really hard. I try as many times a day as I can. Nori this one is for you! You need a sibling!\nZane Lowe: For all the good ones, and all the ones where everyone’s like totally engaged with everything you’re saying, for right or for wrong or whatever, I think you’ve got it totally sussed. I think you know you absolutely know that you’ve talked recently about being the villain, like how you know everyone wants the villain and everyone does well when the villain opens his mouth kinda thing. But then at the end of the day you can go on another interview and you can show a really softer side and a very understanding and very human side that people who know you will tell me you totally are, 100%. And it’s so funny it goes from like “Boooo!” to like “Yeaaaa!” to like “Boooo!” to like “Yeaaaa!” and it’s like, I think you’ve got it sussed, I think you know what’s going on all the time with all of this\nKanye West: You win some games and you lose some\nZane Lowe: You win or you learn right?\nKanye West: Yea, you win or you learn. Bam, there’s a jewel, I’ll take that one with me\nZane Lowe: Right on, quote book. So album this year, sneak attack, no doubt, no question, sneak attack’s coming and um, and there was a leaked poster that came out as well, you gonna tour with Rihanna? Is that out there now? Has that been confirmed or not confirmed, or what the story with that it?\nKanye West: I don’t believe I’m supposed to confirm or not confirm\nZane Lowe: So that’s happening. I’ve been long enough in the tooth to know what that means! Um, but needless to say you’re excited about returning to the stage in some capacity this year and we’re looking forward to new music this year\nKanye West: Yea, and I been doing a few performances since doing the SNL performance, did a couple performances out here and of course gonna do the Brits. I’ve been really liking these performances. I feel like these are like the performance version of that you know Drake, you know of the 6 God album, of the you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late. I feel like I’m a visual extension of what he’s doing like sonically\nZane Lowe: Can we talk about Drake for a second cause he’s just to me he’s the monster at the moment out there\nKanye West: You know… that shit is good yo!\nZane Lowe: Dude, “6PM in New York” – that moment when he’s like opening up and telling the truth about how he feels about his detractors and he’s just basically just opening up what’s going on is my real honesty, not guarding himself or hiding away with any bravado or anything. Just like you know, “they scream my weaknesses and whisper my accomplishments” like pffff I mean that moment for me is just like, that’s what, I mean I love that about him that he’s totally open in the sense\nKanye West: I mean yea, that element is great. There’s a lot of people that can’t rap that can do that. But the main thing is that fact that he’s delivering you know a level of product – as I said last interview, I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering a level of product to humanity that is of high quality. It works. 80% of the time works all the time!\nZane Lowe: That doesn’t make sense!\nKanye West: Haha, but it works. It works. You know what I’m saying. And you have to.. it works. That’s it. And I was just thinking like, I don’t have any advice for this young man, but what I can say is run. Fly. Go as fast as you can. Don’t stop. And you know any time I can be of any service, advice, you know a beat, verse, you know whatever you need. You need some confidential design advice with the shoes you doing over at the other company, I’m not supposed to say that! You know anything that we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the world as a team. You know, not just me and him. Us all\nZane Lowe: Thanks man. I always love talking with you bro, I really do. Alright we’re good\nKanye West: Got some vibes? Bars?\nZane Lowe: Bars!\nKanye West: More bars!",

And its literally only like one of two reason why I havent been able to break that down.\nZL: But why should you feel that you are? Because-\nKW: No! This is the thing you guys dont understand. You guys dont understand. You guys dont understand that I did the Yeezys and they EBAYd for 90 thousand dollars and people wanted them bad as whatever, right? But I didnt get a call from Nike the next day. You guys dont understand that Ive met with companies and they say, \"What were trying to figure out is how we can control you and control that\".

Isnt it point to do it?\nKW: I dont think youre really hearing what Im saying.\nZL: Im trying to\nKW: As a creative, for you to have done something to the level of the Yeezys and not be able to create more and you cannot- you cannot create that on your own, with no support, with no backing. So when I say \"clean water was only served to the fairer skinned\" what Im saying is were making products with chitlins. T-SHIRTS! Thats the most we can make! T-shirts. We could have our best perspective on t-shirts. But if its anything else...\n*HAND SMACK*\nyour Truman Show boat is hitting the wall. And whats more important to me about this than everything I can do sonically and everything is, if I go somewhere else and someone says, \"Hey, we dont like Kanye West\" youve heard that before, right? What people dont realize is I want to make uniforms for my high school basketball team through Brand Yeezy. I want to make that one step, and then make another step, and eventually do uniforms for the entire city, then I want those uniforms to be hot and make money, then I eventually want to be the anchor and the force behind a billion dollar company and after I make that billion dollar step, then I can go in and say I have an opinion on this and that could be a ten billion dollar step, I eventually want to be the anchor of the first trillion dollar company. But when you sit and you have a meeting with a company and show them the most innovate take on theatre because you thought of it one night when you were sitting on top of Watch The Throne set which you designed with Es Devlin, and I designed the set with Es Devlin and thought of, \"Ok, surround vision, there should be a screen above you, below you, to the left, to the right of you and one in front of you also\" then I paid my own money that I get paid for doing Gold Digger, which I never really liked that song but I always knew I would get paid for doing Gold Digger, then I shoot a film in Qatar with three camera crews, with Nate Brown, Virgil, Matt Williams, Nabil, all of these crew- all of the people that every video that pops up every other day on Hypebeast thats my crew, right? So, we go out and shoot that, 3 camera crews over 5 days edited over 30 days, show it at amfAR- no, show it in Cannes, the night before amfAR on the beach, build it in a pyramid with Rem Koolhaas agency, design the entire thing, put editors in it, blah blah blah, people give a standing ovation, I do an interview in New York Times the next year to say, \"Hey, I did this and I want to let you know I did it\", right? And then, it doesnt get mentioned in the interview and a week later they do an interview with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and theyre talking about what the next frontier of theatre will be and how itll be higher priced tickets and itll be something thats surrounding you and blah blah blah, maybe its in the goggles, I said, \"Wait a second, I just only did the interview to tell people that I invented it. I made it.\"\nLike I went, I remember when I was, uh, dropping William Morris, right, and then Sarah Newkirk at that time said \"Before you drop them, go meet with Ari Emanuel\" and I sat with him and I said, \"Ari, Im an inventor\" and he goes on to tell me about the way it works and what he said was \"You are a celebrity. So basically whats going to happen is, theres product here, and this is where you end up, right here. If you can communicate the product you can make money of the product, cause look at Gaga. Shes the Creative Director of Polaroid.\" I like some the Gaga songs. What the fuck does she know about cameras? So it becomes all of this thing where all of the musicians- the musicians try to get more money by promoting other products, right? So youll say \"Hey, you know what? Ive got this water and weve got, you know, weve got this red version. We got a red bottle, and weve got a David Beckham version here, then we got a blue version.\" So my opinion is no more than the patina on top of it, when I understand the reason from my core of why something should work all the way through. So, I understand we want to make it about music but I wanted to take this step to say, we got this new thing called \"Classism\". Its racisms cousin. This is what we do to hold people back. This is what we do. And we got this other thing we got that has been working for a long time where you dont have to be racist anymore its called \"Self-Hate\"; it works on itself. Its like real estate of racism. Where, just like that, when someone comes up and says something like \"I am a god\", everybody says \"Who does he think he is?\" I just told you who I thought I am, a god! I just told you! Thats who I think I am! Would it have been better if I had a song that said, \"I am a nigga\"? or if I had song that said \"I am a gangsta\"? or if I had song that said \"I am a pimp\"? All those color and patinas fit better on a person like me, right? But to say you are a god? Especially, when you got shipped over to the country that youre in, and your last name is a slave owners. How can you say that; how could you have that mentality?\nZL: I mean, I know in the past youve talked about, like, you know, building hotels, doing things beyond peoples normal frame of reference. They know you as Kanye West, an artist. They know youre moving into fashion, but these things in a way I guess are hard on people to comprehend because they dont have that level of drive. Do you know what I mean? Has it always been like this for you? Have you always felt like you can set your mind on anything and you will achieve it, ultimately?\nKW: Ive always felt I can do anything. Thats the main thing people are controlled by, thoughts- the perceptions of themselves. Theyre slowed down by the perception of themselves. If youre taught you cant do anything you wont do anything. I was taught I could do everything and Im Kanye West at age 36. So just watch the next ten years.\nZL: Yea yea yea.",

"Prof. Nick Cave: Kanye, you join us today to be recognized for your transformative, genre-defining work across music, performance, film, and fashion design. Your visionary and ambitious career is a true reflection of the creative spirit. So, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Governors of the School of the Arts Institute of Chicago and the Board of Trustees of the Art Institute of Chicago, I now confer upon you the degree of Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts, Dr. West\nDr. Kanye West: I’m sorry, that was just my opinion\nI am a pop artist. So, my medium is public opinion and the world is my canvas\n“I’m sorry” is something that you can use a lot. It gives you the opportunity to give your opinion, apologize for it, and give your opinion again. People say you should not be sorry for your opinions. George Bush… has some very cool self-portraits. I didn’t know he was an artist\nI felt my nerves a bit, and I don’t feel that feeling a lot. The nerves of humility and modesty when being honored; a humanization, a reality of being recognized. And all I thought as I sit here kinda shaking a little bit is “I need to get rid of that feeling.” I need to not be nervous\nThis honor is gonna make your lives easier. Two reasons: you don’t have to defend me as much, and I’m gonna make all of our lives easier. And it’s these Floyd Mayweather belts that are needed to prove what I’ve been saying my entire life. Whether it’s the cosign of Paul McCartney grabbing me and saying, “It’s okay, he doesn’t bite white people,” or the New York Times cover, or the Time “Most Influential” cover, and now a doctorate at The Art Institute of Chicago\nWhen I was giving a lecture at Oxford, I brought up this school because when I went on that mission to create in other spaces – apparel, film, performance – it would have been easier if I could have said: \"I have a degree at the Art Institute of Chicago.\"\nThank you",

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, hes like \"Who that spittin?\" Im like \"Its me.\" Hes like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin me to send him beats, and Im thinking hes trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with\nSo wont you raise your glass, wont you?\nSo wont you raise your glass, wont you?\nSo wont you raise your glass, wont you?\nSo wont you raise your glass, wont you?\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\nIm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but thats how I got in the game. If it wasnt for that, I wouldnt be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, thats what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, hes like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really werent soundin right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now its kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Cant Be Life.\"\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what Im sayin cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\nAnd he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I aint want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what Im sayin, man what Ima tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man Im, Im just in Chicago, Im trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts Im trying to get on, and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like Im just straight holdin the phone, gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadnt even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like OOOOOOOOOOH. Two days later Im in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didnt know who I was and I was like, \"Yo whats up Im Kanye.\"\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\nYou know I aint talkin shit. Im like \"oh shit.\" And all this time Im starstruck, man. Im still thinking bout, you know Im picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, Im lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the Cant be Life beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"Im killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so thats all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\nThat was it. You know, I aint get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didnt have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&Rs, and they wanted beats from me, so theyd call me up, Id play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So Ill play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then Ill play my shit. Ill be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know, cause I aint have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them \"Jesus Walks\" and they didnt sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&Rs that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, itd be somebody at the company thatll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\nIm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up\nLets just say I didnt get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasnt even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure its not wack.\"\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually its a song that youll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, its called Wow.\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\nLike the chorus went. Dont bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and hes like \"oh shit\"\n\"I aint gonna front, its kinda hot.\"\nLike they still werent looking at me like a rapper. And Im sure Dame figured, Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and hes like \"yo man, B, B, you dont want a brick, you dont want a brick\"\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, youll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and Im a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, Im not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh hes just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day Im talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I dont know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\nSo wont you raise your glass, wont you?\nSo wont you raise your glass, wont you?\nSo wont you raise your glass, wont you?\nSo wont you raise your glass, wont you?",

"Lou Stoppard:\nKanye West, welcome to SHOWstudio. Were gonna be answering questions from some of your fans, some of your friends, some of your peers. But the first question I wanna ask you, its actually from me, so Lou from London. Youre one of the most famous men in the world and I think everyone has an opinion about you - I really noticed that as we were preparing for this interview. Everyone thinks they know you. Ive watched quite a lot of your interviews recently and youve really talked about this idea of not being heard. Theres quite an irony to that cause you have such a huge direct reach, but I got the sense youve really felt you were not being listened to or not being understood. Do you think everyone fully understands Kanye West? Or do you think youre very different to your public persona? Have you created that in some way?\nKanye West:\nYeah, I think theres people who understand. They see it. Thats the same people who see an earthquake coming on, or see a tsunami coming. I think there’s people who don’t want to embrace what it really is so they use their position of like class, or snobbery, or whatever comments they have, to just try to always down things and to not give it its just due, or just opportunity as a form of discrimination. You know, most people dont understand who they are. So peoples misunderstanding to me is a misunderstanding to themselves. That they dont understand that hes not being the projected version of himself. Hes not what he was taught by current society or taught by this lifetime. Hes evoking something from another place and this is unfamiliar; its alien to us. You know, its easier for us shun it, than to really try to dig deeper and find out more about it. Its funny that so many people that are supposed to be like so super educated love to just pick the lowest hanging fruit of a concept of fame or celebrity. as a way to diminish or to take away the validation of what is being done up to this point and what will be done in the future.\nLS: Talking about what you did in the past and what you want to do in the future. A question that was submitted by one of you fans, Sam Hollis. He said, what do you consider your greatest contribution to music, but also your greatest contribution to creativity?\nKW: Well, Im answering the second question first. The greatest contribution to creativity is taking away the bullying. Well, Im sure that Ive bullied myself sometimes, but taking away people being able to bully you because youre a creative. Were bullied and controlled by organisations and money and the people with money are in power. And thats gonna change after me and Kims lifetime. Its gonna go more back to when people used to philosophise and talk about proportions and shape and colour and what we can do for the next generations, but right now its all about what people can do to make the most money and how they can not cut in creatives in any profit and use creatives against themselves in a way. Like if they know someone is a genius but not business smart, they take advantage of that. So, me constantly fighting that on the front line I think is the greatest thing I’ve tried to open up, so that creatives can be more empowered, because I believe the world can be saved or helped, and the world meaning us as human beings, our civilisation, us as a race, as one race, can be helped through allowing people with more positive motives, who see more colours than just green. To help be at least a part of the conversation and be heard and listened to. What was the first question?\nLS: It was about your greatest contribution to music, but maybe you don’t think like that anymore?\nKW: Yeah… music synthesis. Just to synthesise. To take Mos Def and bring him to the studio with Jay Z, I think is the greatest... When people say ‘oh this is backpack or this is gangster,’ or to go on tour with Roc-A-Fella with a chain and have people boo me and be like ‘Roc-A-Fella is not hip hop’ and fight against that. Now, it’s considered to be one art form. Like what Louise Wilson would always talk about, there’s this juxtaposition, high, low, these opposites and combining them. This combination that makes a greater civilisation and a greater human being. The actual human being a thousand years from now, generally, as a race we should be far advanced. Like at the beginning of ‘Prometheus’, like how that guy was just like *chtchhhhhe noise*. He was like Mike Tyson meets Steve Jobs meets Shakespeare as a person. There was a time when people were working on multiple things and have multiple art forms and businesses and different things that they could do but now you’re only supposed to be able to do one thing and in the future, people will be highly skilled in a lot of things because they won’t be afraid to fight for their education\nLS: I think it makes people uncomfortable, doesnt it, when people try and kind of get themselves out of their box. They see musicians as musicians and when you do fashion it makes people annetuate. This relates to a question that came in from Nick Knight - he runs SHOWstudio, who you collaborate with a lot. He talks about your bravery. He said you seem, sort of, be open to make very brave decisions. And I think in some points that relates to pushing yourself into new arenas. He gave examples like opening Black Skinhead with three black KKK hoods and not putting New Slaves on YouTube or appearing naked in the Black Skinhead video. Hes interested, do these decisions feel brave at the time? Do you feel brave? And maybe whats the bravest thing youve ever done?\nKW: I mean, theres nothing to be afraid of, really. I dont ever wanna take to much credit for being brave. Thats just a responsibility of ours, as artists, to give our truth at time. And its just as simple as that. Soldiers are brave, they have a serious responsibility to go fight for their countries, police officers are brave, fire fighters, its their responsibility to go into a fire. And for the rest, an artists responsibility to give our truth. I just think more than courage or bravery, its just, I...\nLS: Honesty?\nKW: Yeah, honesty. Maybe the answer didnt... some answers Im gonna give are not gonna make complete sense, if youre a very literal-by-the-book person. You might find a flaw in the final finishing. I suppose you understand the just of what Im saying. And, you know, the other day I came up with an equation that explains the way visionaries think, I suppose to very calculated people. As someone as you, get 2 and 3, most people will say 5. If you put 2 and 3 in front of me, Im gonna say: well, 2 plus 3 is five, 2 times 3 is 6, 2 divided by 3 is this and 3 divided by 2 is that and then come up with an average of all those things. And then when you say 5.76 blah blah blah, thats the thing that people marvel at. Like, wow, that really was not what I was expecting or not what we wanted to put you in a box for. But I felt I got something more out of it and that is the calculation of the Zeitgeist. Because everything changes, every day something changes. People get so caught up in the embarrasment of changing their mind in front of someone. And one thing can change everything. So you have to put that, as a part of your 2 and 3. You dont have to, I have put it as a part of my 2 and 3 equation.\nLS: Its interesting you use the world visionary there. A lot of our viewers, they ask questions about that term and about the term creative genius. Sam Thompson, he has this question where he said, youve called yourself that and equated yourself to these different people; Da Vinci, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, Michaelangelo. He asks, how would you define a genius in that context? But also, why do you feel the need to call yourself that?\nKW: Because otherwise Im called celebrity. Im called nigger. Im called rapper. And when they use the word celebrity, nigger, rapper, isnt that in a positive way. And all these things, all these words, can be used in an extremely positive way: \"whats up my nigger\", you know. But thats not the way its used. So I have to define who I am. All of my aspirations are the things that currently only sixty-year old white people do. So I have to redefine and let people know exactly who I am and its not letting them know by, you know, wearing a suit or letting them know by wearing a Rolex or letting them know by bragging about how much money a sponsorship made on top of a rap. Its letting them know by saying, \"lets start with this, Im a creative genius\". *Laughs* Its proven and now well continue to prove it. When people try to take the piss out of me for clothing and this and that. They never think about the fact that Ive never had the opportunity to be properly educated and if given the meanings to be properly educated or given the proper support groups, I would completely shhh, light the lights up. We sell shoes that people wanna line up for because we put love in them, we put heart in them, we want to make Christmas presents, we want to make something that people want so bad that it hurts them if they cant have it. It not a... its not a... just a financial oppertunity, cause you need finances. But its a form of discrimination and racism, especially with blacks and fashion. And it literally, you know, it took me, being Kanye West, to get this far in fashion. Meaning, I was being able to become a multimiljonair and invest in myself, because no one else would have. I got this employee, thats a black guy and there will be, sometimes there will be a piece of misinformation. Three weeks later hell tell me something and he says it kinda, like, with his voice down. I remember being with my dad and my dad was the type of dad that would be everybodys dad. A guy would come in and sell some cookies, but my dad was a sellsman also. So hes saying, \"excuse me, I got these cookies\" and hed say \"yo, sir, pick your head up and explain to me what you wanna say and what you wanna sell\". This guy, this employee, because blacks especially in America have been raised with slave mentality, dont feel they have the right to speak as loud as possible. And everytime you hear a black person speaking as loud as possible, its after someones gotta say \"look at this niggers over there\". So if you dont want to be called a name in a derogatory way. Youd rather put it in whats peoples favorite word to use for me? Humble? But if we go on your iPhone on a dictionary and look up the word humble, eighty procent of the definition is negative. Its a controlling word. Its a way to control the masses and to control the sheep. Yeah, I think there’s a level of reality to being nice, to being cordial to people. But if you have the ability to lead, you are a leader. You have the answers or you have the ability to find people with the answers and your will is to help. You should not be humble, you should speak up, because this world is broken. So someone needs to say something and sometimes I just feel like the only one thats not crazy.\nLS: I want to ask you a question thats relatable to what you were saying. The question came in quite a lot, but it was posted particularly nicely by Aravin Sandran, hes 25 and from London. And he said, \"do you think the resistance and criticisms to your work is being partly because youre a black man. Would your ideas and work received differently if you were a white man?\"\nKW: If I was a white man that became a really successful musician, that box would have put me in a chamber that would have said that I shouldn’t work. So there’s a lot of white people that if they’re really super good at something, they also get discriminated against in another field. You could be a photographer and someone would say you can’t be an artist. You could be a designer and someone would say you can’t be a musician or someone would say you can’t be a film director. As far as the advantages in life, yes, if you are born white, you have that on your gene pool. Currently because the world is controlled by whites, you have that as a 100, as an advantage, and if you add a couple of other things to it, you have a very high chance of success. Whereas, because the world is run by whites currently, if you’re born black, if you make it to something like the Met Ball or the Grammys, most likely you’ve done ten times the amount of everyone else there to get there.\nLS: Its interesting, Simon Foxton, whos a stylist. I know you know his work. Asks the question that relates as well. He said, your clothing line has been greeted with a lot of harsh criticism. Do you reflect like a lot of designers do, where they take that criticism and they use it to kind of develop their aesthetic and change their work? So do you do that? Or does it just make you even more convinced in your belief and vision?\nKW: Yeah, I’m convinced that I know what I like and I know that I just know. I know and I don’t care. I don’t care because anyone that is criticising, most likely they saw the 350s and acted like they didn’t like them because they’re racist and discriminatory. They’re not only racist against black people; they discriminate against celebrity. They discriminate against people with multiple art forms. Or they could say, ‘Oh wait a second, that cut wasn’t that good,’ but they do enough to throw a stab at, ‘Oh that didn’t fall the right way’ or ‘That wasn’t styled the right way.’ But they didn’t do the research on how difficult it was to one by one put together a design team and to fight against the idea of celebrity, to get overcharged because you’re a musician or people feel like you have money, to get completely taxed by the fashion world. And I love it because it’s like going to Harvard. That’s the reason why I’m in fashion. I think it’s the ultimate training because I dropped out of art school. Eventually, I got a PHD this year, like a honorary PHD at the Art Institute of Chicago. I dropped out of that school and I wanted to go back to the school of hard knocks. Right now, in all honesty... You know whatever the fuck I’m going to say today, I’m going to say it and I’m just gonna fucking own it and that’s how I feel right now. If I feel differently in three years, I’ll tell you how I feel... but right now, the highest art form is actually fashion. What’s funny about that is people in art look down at fashion designers. It’s like a class... I mean, where’s architecture? The most energy currently is around fashion because with music, it’s in question if a song is popular, if that person is really a good artist or not. In fashion, for the most part, if someone is really popular, it’s because it’s agreed upon that they’re an amazing artist. They’re amazing at what they’ve done. People do the history on what their background is. Did they intern for Christian Lacroix? Did they work at Margiela for a period? They find out what the history is and see if that someone is making a connection to something that is current, that’s relative, that is in touch. And fashion designers are superstars currently too. It feels like hip-hop felt to me in the nineties. It’s like, me, I’m a hip-hop artist but it’s like why are you going to the fashion world? I mean it’s just a really interesting art form. It’s just a different art form. Business is an art, the way you talk to people is art, an interview can be an art, everything is a form of art. I appreciate the critics because when I see the collection I just did and when I used the stretch French Terry that I found in Japan and I use on market canvas, like heavyweight canvas, and I put it in my colour palette and I see 64 different tones come down together, you know, I’ve created like a moving expressionist painting and that satisfies me. So if someone was to go up to a Monet and say, ‘This dot wasn’t Louis Vuitton level,’ it’d be like, ‘What do you mean?’ It’s all an expressionist painting. By the way, you know we die. 80 years, 60 years, 50 years, you know we will die. But on that day, I lived.\nLS: A question that came in from Natalie Wo, it goes back to what you said about your dad. Your dad was in the Black Panthers and your last collection did have a very political undertone. It was very much about racism.\nKW: Wait a second, is that a white person who said that?\nLS: I don’t know her ethnicity\nKW: I think it’s racist when white people assume when a black person uses colour, it’s a political statement.\nLS: Were you not making a political statement?\nKW: No! It’s a painting. It’s beautiful colours. That statement is not gonna stop the murders in Chicago. That statement is not gonna help people get jobs. That statement is not gonna take guns out of hands in Atlanta. That statement is not going to stop Zimmerman from bragging about… It’s such a thing like I had this one stylist come up to me and Virgil was standing next to me and said, ‘You need to watch out for him. He’s taking your place.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, the one spot for the black guy at the dinner table in fashion? That place? Is that what you’re talking about?’ So the assumption that my artistic expression of clothing has something to do with race or politics - a more politically correct term ironically for racism - is racist in itself.\nLS: A lot of fashion designers do see their work as political so maybe that’s why people see your work as political or about social issues. Perhaps it’s a compliment. They want to read something into your work because they think it has depth and it matters. It doesn’t seem like you see it like that? Like McQueen’s work for example, people saw it as political.\nKW: Yeah, I’m not gonna let anyone score points on me. If someone asks me about something, I’m gonna block all shots and I’m not gonna take any free points. I’m not gonna have someone say, ‘Oh I heard you knocked that guy out two weeks ago while this happened,’ and I would be like, ‘Oh yeah…’ No. If it wasn’t my intention for it to be political and everyone gives it this credit, and somehow they’re giving it a credibility, I’m like well no… I don’t even want that kind of credit. I don’t want anything that I don’t deserve. I just want a chance to drink at the clear fountain. I just want a clean shot. I just want a clean bat to swing, I want a clean bat to be able to swing at the ball with. Every one of these questions are gonna show the amount of dirt that’s actually on the bat.\nLS: Do you think it would be easier for you if you weren’t famous then?\nKW: Yeah, being famous is like the n-word. People remind me at every meeting about how famous I am. But somehow…. No, it wouldn’t be easier. The answer is absolutely no. You need fame in order to sell your shit. That’s why people pay for advertisers. So I’m basically the first of a celebrity that approached his entire career and life like he was an old bag brand that went and re-did itself and went and got a really cool designer that Anna Wintour suggested, to revitalise it and became a really big brand… Meaning like celebrities have always had a way that they were supposed to do business with licensing deals and this and this, but I always approach myself in a luxury way whether it’s calling Nick Knight a million times to work with him or going to factories in Italy or begging Tessiclub which hasn’t called me back yet to use their fabrics because they do Celine and Lanvin. I’ve always fought just to have better paints to work with. When I was in high school, I was at this national competition where I did a watercolour and the colour was really intense and I lost the competition because the judges were confused. They said either it’s not really watercolour because the paint was too thick or I used watercolour in the wrong way. So I lost because of that. I don’t know where those judges are today but…\nLS: It wasnt the best feedback. You mentioned Anna Wintour and I wanna bring her up. She actually sent us a question for you. She said, what will you name your son and what do you hope for him as he gets older?\nKW: I don’t have a name for him, but what I hope for him is that he can feel purpose, that he can learn, that he has the opportunities. The other night, I was driving in Paris and I saw these three high school kids running at top speed. I don’t know if they were chasing a guy or what. Once they got up to the street, there was a bus pulling off and they’re beating on the side of the bus. Then I looked at the time and it was 1am so that might be the last bus of the night. And I was really saddened because I was like, ‘How can I make my son feel that?’ Because once you’ve felt that, none of these fucking questions matter. When you’ve missed that last bus before, when you had the opportunity to get on the bus, you don’t give a fuck about any of this.\nLS: When have you felt that?\nKW: When I’ve missed the last fucking bus! Going through the streets of Chicago and having to sleep downtown in a parking lot.\nLS: Do you still get that feeling today about different things?\nKW: No, it’s almost like not feeling anything. It’s almost like being numb because of what I went through. There’s an employee that I’m about to hire that was the global manager of accessories at a really good company and she was really direct in the way she was talking. Then she went into this thing about how she stayed in a concentration camp till she was five years old and she didn’t know that people actually took showers by themselves. After someone’s been through something like that, they could give a fuck less about fuck. It’s just like... be real. None of this facade.\nLS: Do you care about the negative press coverage around you and your family? But also just the general coverage that your every move is scrutinised?\nKW: Yeah. And that’s the reason why, with the help of Anna Wintour and other people, we have actually made a lot of positive press coverage. The majority of the press we get is actually positive because the majority of the things that we do are actually positive. And even the negative can’t outshine the truth. The truth shall come to light. You see it in front of you. You read this thing and they try to diminish me into some really simple concept and simple idea and every time someone has a conversation about this and that, they’re like, ‘Wow, it’s a possibility that he’s thinking about more things and he wants to contribute more than I thought.’ So, let me dig into what I think the gist is of what that person was asking. Do I worry about being in the public eye and raising kids? Yeah. Any situation you’re in, you’re going to worry about raising kids. But it’s champagne problems too. There’s people who can’t feed their kids. That’s something more to worry about. So I’m not going to sit here and complain about the so-called issues I have. These aren’t real issues. There’s people at war. There’s people trying to make it to London right now. It’s really fucking serious. You guys are talking to me about some celeb shit. That’s not real shit. You know what? I’m alive. I’m breathing. I did a show. We sell it. I’m doing a second collection. I have no problems.\nLS: Talking about the bigger things that do change who you are and completely affect your work. Carine Roitfeld, the stylist, she ask how has becoming a father changed the way you work?\nKW: Well, the way it changed who I was... Three years ago, after this interview, I would have been on a train back to Paris to see the last of the shows and get that inspiration. And now, I’m on the first flight back home to see my greatest inspiration, that’s my daughter.\nLS: A lot of people have asked about your daughter. A particular one has to do with having a daughter and how its changed the type of explicit lyrics you put into a song. And the way you talk about women in your songs. That question came from Ashley Geevers. She asked if having a daughter specifically affected the way you depict women in your music.\nKW: Having a family period has completely made me rethink the way I rap. You know people extend their brand for a long time. There’s true moments of genius and then there’s just moments of looking through the archives and placing shit together. So many people rate ‘My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy’ as one of the best albums. And ‘Yeezus’ and ‘808s & Heartbreak’ are so much better and stronger. ‘Dark Fantasy’ is almost like an apology record. ‘Power’ was the least progressive song that I ever had as a first single. It was like me going back and spending six dedicated months - it took over two years to release the album - but six dedicated months piecing together what people liked about me, to make an entire bouquet that they loved, that was the most listenable, that was the least challenging. People want to talk about how much they loved that like it was Thanksgiving dinner. And how long has Thanksgiving dinner been cooked for? And it’s great, you don’t want anybody changing things on Thanksgiving dinner. But you take ‘808s’ or ‘Yeezus’ where these albums got completely panned when they came out and then you see how they end up influencing things. So it’s that balance of doing something that gives you a blanket of comfortability for the listeners and for yourself that you can go on tour and do this and walk around and everybody thinks it’s so great and they’re really happy that you did something they liked. And then you’ve got the times when you just have to give them what you see as your future. Give them your innovation.\nLS: And having a family gives you more motivation to do that? To be more true to yourself?\nKW: No.\nLS: That just comes from you?\nKW: I just love my family.\nLS: You talked about wanting to be given a shot and wanting to have your opportunity. Do you actually believe that one day you will be respected and regarded as one of the greatest of all time in fashion in exactly the same way you are in music?\nKW: Of course. I’m Michelangelo. Of course. There’s a time when I’m sure there were people sculpting better than Michelangelo, but he made David. So as far as that question goes, is there a time that you can go on the internet and find a shoe that people want more than my shoes? Well go fuck yourself then if it isn’t and don’t ask me no stupid shit like that again. With the love.\nLS: Do you ever experience self-doubt?\nKW: No.\nLS: Never?\nKW: No.\nLS: Even when you were little?\nKW: No.\nLS: Okay, good to know. One thing that came in from a lot of people: they picked up on that quote of your fashion being available to everybody. They want to know what that means and when it will happen because price point really relates to that.\nKW: I’m not H&M, I don’t have giant factories. How can I get the price point to what I need to be if I’m running an eight person design team... I’m saying it’s going to take time to get there. This is what I’m saying when you don’t have the right tools. This is the question that everybody has to ask. If you had the Celine design team and the Nike design studio and the Zara factory, could you do everything that you thought you could do? And what would everyone’s answer be to that? Yes. But if you don’t have the Celine outerwear person or the factory or you don’t have the entire adidas studio and you don’t have the marketing team or the sales team, you can only do what you can do. And we are doing a lot with what we have. What we have is the highest level of communication that has happened in the entire universe. My wife. She’s like MTV and NBC and all this combined. Number one on Instagram. And then the entire family. And then you have me and my entire music family. Basically, there is no ad that you can put in any magazine that could somehow add up to any one of me or my friends or my family just walking on the street and getting photographed. That is the fucking reality of 2015 people!\nLS: Does that make it easier to care less about critics? Because as you say, it doesnt really matter what they say. The percentage of people that would engage with that is a fraction of the percentage of people that would see one Instagram post from Kim.\nKW: Yeah you know… I mean, what can I say about them? I appreciate everyone’s opinion, but I refuse to have a lesser opinion about myself.\nLS: What specifically do you think fashion is missing that you can bring?\nKW: I’m not even concerned about bringing something to fashion. I’m just... I just want to be five years old. You know, when I was five years old I picked out my outfit for kindergarten. I would go to discount furrier, my mum would take me to discount furrier and I would keep grabbing furs and say, ‘What about this one mum? Or this one?’ And they were always too expensive. The ones I liked when I was five. So I just want to be five years old. I loved clothes before I even knew a fuck about the fashion world. And I can’t let the fashion world jade anything or try to give me a reason, or purpose, or a lack of purpose, or acceptance or a lack of acceptance to anything to just who I am when I was five. When my grandfather had a store in Oklahoma and he’d go to the flea market and hustle to get the best prices. He’d go and re-do people’s furniture, he was a carpenter also. He took that store and he was able to raise a family in a time where the schools were still segregated and he named my mother Donda in 1949. He was predicting the future in 1949 and put himself in a situation where he was thirteen and his father put 50 cents in his hand and told him he was out of there. He raised himself in a situation to be able to put my mother into college to the point where she got a PhD and became the first black female chair of Chicago state University. And then had a son that she then named Kanye which meant the only one that would go on to combat every form of thought, of tradition, that the media have presented up to that point. So tell me about other people’s opinions again?\nLS: Is it your family who have had the biggest impact on your creativity, your sense of self and what you produce? Or were there other influences? It feels like all your creativity came from your sense of self, which obviously came from your family. Or am I wrong?\nKW: I can’t say where my creativity came from. I’m blessed to be talented. I would say that came from God. My ability to give a fuck about somebody’s opinion came from my family. My ability to fight for my creativity came from my family. I’m sure people would just take that Michelangelo comment I said earlier and would take offense to that and think ‘Whoa, he still won’t stop.’ Let me just explain the justification of that. The proof of that. Ask any musician, period, of the past fifteen years - and I would be the closest thing to that. Those were be the sonic paintings. Fashion, clothes are sculptures, wearable art. Now, if you think about any brand, do you love every single thing from a brand? Look at the few opportunities I got to collaborate with Louis Vuitton, Nike, Adidas, really established companies and the level of love and impact people have for that product. That had proper infrastructure. So I had to take the money I made from being the motherfucking Michelangelo of music of the past fifteen years and invest it in trying to build an infrastructure against all odds, and basically building a sculpture studio. So I wanted to raise the branch up a little bit higher on that low-hanging fruit everyone was going to snatch at.\nLS: Why run for president? You have proven to be more influential than a president and running for office would limit your ideas. Everything you could do and would want to do as president can be done now. Other great leaders, Gandhi, Mandala, never needed to be elected to make a change, so why do you feel the need? \nKW: Mandela got elected.\nLS: Yeah, he’s fourteen, give him a break.\nKW: Okay, I won’t start cursing at him. Certain things that I’m compelled to do in life, I don’t feel the need to find justification for.\nLS: So you’re definitely going to do it?\nKW: Yeah.\nLS: When you made that announcement, was it something you decided on the day or did it just come in the moment that you felt that and you just said it?\nKW: It had been talked about a lot for the past five years and talked about with my team and I decided I was going to announce it then.\nLS: Do you think Barack Obama has done enough? A lot of people have asked you that.\nKW: I don’t want to make comments or give opinions on what other people have done. I think he’s done a lot of great things and I think that there would be no chance of people even considering the concept of me running if he hadn’t have won.\nLS: Will you run with a party or will you run alone?\nKW: I don’t have all the answers right now.\nLS: What do you plan to do? What are the some of the things you really want to do when you’re in leadership?\nKW: I’d like to sit with engineers and come up with solutions and alternatives for people without opportunity that end up having to go through desperate measures or feel like life isn’t worth living or that other people’s lives don’t matter. I think that the way I collaborate with people and the way I empower the people I collaborate with is a different way to look at problem solving for the world than a normal political way. I just want to ask questions. I’ve already decide that when I’m on debates and I don’t know I’ll just say ‘I don’t know, I’ll get back to you with that’ and I’ll just consult with the top ten, top five people on the planet and if there isn’t an absolute right answer I’ll say ‘These are the two highest answers that we came up with right now,’ because it’s not about me. It’s we. That’s the whole purpose. It’s the skill set that brought me back from the original Taylor Swift moment, the skill set that took the little kid in the pink polo to the top of the rap game. That skill set that took a Nike designer and three Adidas designers and made the hottest shoe. The skill set that brought by wife to the cover of Vogue. All of these journeys that… Like these questions say, these absolute, like, this can’t be done, have been almost self-serving and that’s where it gets the I-I-I. It’s from me and it’s from my family. My family meaning my direct family, but what happens if there is a certain point where it doesn’t become about me and my family but my family becomes the human race. I can do all the fight, all of that confidence, all of that problem solving, all of that asking questions, all of that trying to find the best answers, and listening through… If I could maybe do that to help more people and you can help more people in a position of power to go back to the gentleman’s question earlier. These are just now in a theory form, but I am speaking from the heart.\nLS: A few people have correlated the president run with your lyrics and particularly the lyric about No one man should have all that power. It’s interesting, you just said you can change your mind, you can be wrong about things. Do you sometimes feel your own ideas have changed so much in the years you’ve been working?\nKW: Of course because you get new information.\nLS: Does it frustrate you though? Because people are inevitably going to draw the parallel between the lyric and the fact you’re going to run for president.\nKW: That’s not frustrating. There were some things earlier that were frustrating to me because they were so backhanded and ignorant in their approach, not really embracing... But no one’s being like ‘Man, I know I saw people lined up for three days for your shoes but one day, will you be respected as a designer?’ I designed that shoe, didn’t I? I don’t see somebody else’s shoes getting lined up for. I think there are a lot of fourteen year old, fifteen year old, twenty-five year old, thirty-five year old people that respect me as a designer.\nLS: I met you at a dinner in Paris with Riccardo Tisci and we had a really great talk and one thing stuck in my mind. You said that you felt that there was a new form of racism called class, and no one was talking about it. I found that really interesting because I come from a radical background, my father was a Marxist and you told me your parents were also radicals. Can you explain to me more what you mean about that and is that something you want to explore further? \nKW: Yeah it’s... class is education. People not having the opportunity to be educated. The biggest thing that made me the uncontrollable whatever is simply by being educated. Simply being educated made me uncontrollable. It’s not that I needed to be controlled. I needed to be helped, I needed to be supported. I dont wish negative on anyone. I want positive for everyone. I want everyone to win. I don’t want to be in a competition with anyone. I just want people to be their best selves and live the happiest lives possible. If you keep information and opportunity away from people, certain people, a group of people, then it’s destined they will stay at a lower class. The combination of that and being American. Because I found sometimes when I’ve worked at other design studios in London before, I find that because of the way the government is set up, people won’t have the opportunity to say they will run for being the Queen. I’m going to run for the Queen! That’s from birth. And you couldn’t be the president of United States because you’re not a United States citizen. So it sort of circumcises your dreams from day one. Whereas American is like a land of opportunity when people can work their way, climb their way up through the class system. But to be truly honoured as a black person in what is a classless society, the final house in the suburban community with the white picket fence and to be looked at as an equal is still a lot of mixed kids away from that. But the world is mixing. Period. So in a thousand years, the world might just be completely, what would be known as black currently, but it would just be a new race, except for people whose main goal and focus at that time is to keep the purity of separatism. But I see the future as people being mixed. I think that other races are really attracted to each other and always have been, because I believe that we’re meant to, but taught to not. I was taught to never bring a white girl home when I was eight years old. But I like white girls. I liked black girls too but I still liked white girls. It was such a taboo. I’m sure, like I said in the Tyler song ‘I know you told your daughters don’t take home Jerom.,’ I’ll tell you from my single days that white women like black guys, I tell you that, but I think there’s something amazing about mixing the cultures and the amount of informations that both cultures bring to the table. Or three cultures or four cultures. You ask a girl and she’ll say: ‘I’m German and Portuguese and Asian.’ Just when I gave you that right now. What do you picture in your mind? There are probably guys gong: ‘Ah shit, I have to meet this German-Portuguese-Asian girl right now!’ They already picture someone beautiful. Just by me naming different races together and having the idea that a woman is saying that she’s mixed with these, you picture automatically someone beautiful.\nLS: A lot of people asked about your vision for the world and what you’d like it to be like. It seems like that mixing of ethnicities and cultures is the most important thing to you?\nKW: I’m not telling people who they should sleep with. I’m just zoning in on what I feel today.\nLS: Do you feel like if you haven’t dropped out, you would be where you are? Because I think education is important but maybe the ability to opt out of the system is also important.\nKW: I think I would be further and more dangerous. Yes, education is important. I’m envious of people who have read multiple novels and multiple philosophy books. I wish I had more information. I’m thirsty for knowledge. I’m busy with my own ideas. I want to pick up a book and see something that sparks me and it makes me think of thirty things I want to do and I’ll put down the book and start working on that. I’m envious of information. So college dropout… Now me at my age I’m looking... OK what were the reasons why I lost money when I did this? What was the reasons why I failed at that? It all came to not having the playbook, to not having information. With me, when I work on fashion I’m sitting here in the woods trying to chop down trees screaming screaming at the top of my lungs: ‘Can somebody just throw me some water?’ and everyone’s sitting laughing at me. That’s the fashion world, that’s the fashion critics. Me sitting here, trying my absolute hardest and everyone just laughing at me. And only one person coming up with a camera and Nick shooting a shot that then shoots across the world and they say ‘Oh he’s working with Nick Knight,’ and then Pat coming in doing the makeup, they go: ‘Oh, he’s working with Pat,’ or Riccardo coming in and saying: ‘No you can’t talk about Kim, this is my friend right here,’ they say: ‘Oh wow, the hottest designer likes Kim.’ Then the fashion world is like: ‘Hmm maybe it’s okay.’ And then they come again and say: ‘What do you think we can capitalise off of this in some way? Well come, come! We can capitalise and shit!’ But they definitely were not fucking letting me in the shows, and fucking constantly laughing at me, and trying to keep the joke going. But you know, there’s a lot of tsunamis and earthquakes that hit where people were joking on the beach. So keep joking on the beach.\nLS: The Kim thing is interesting to me. I feel, particularly working in fashion, I feel like I’ve watched it happen, the period where people were so critical and now they want her in their shows, they want to dress her they want her on the front row. That must upset you in a way because she’s your wife and as you said you love her. To see that U-turn, in a way, it’s great, because it shows how much people respect her and they can see how amazing her influence is, but also that back-handedness. Is that difficult? Because you must feel protective.\nKW: It’s always, always… it’s better now than it was and I feel happy about that.\nLS: We got a question from a guy who talked about gay people within music and within the rap world and stigma towards homosexual rappers. He talked about how you talk a lot about society moving past stigma and being accepting. He said do you feel that’s still a problem within music?\nKW: Yeah, it’s funny. Isn’t it so funny how just the culture of different art forms is so different? I felt that I got discriminated against in fashion also for not being gay whereas in music, you definitely get discriminated against if you are gay. It takes some amazing talents to really break down that barrier. People don’t have a problem with white rappers now because Eminem ended up being the greatest artist and everybody thought that when Frank Ocean’s album dropped, that people were going to be like, ‘No, this is bad for his career,’ and he’s one of the greatest writers of all time... I feel like it’s so cliche to speak about him particularly related to this subject but there always are the people who broke the ground and I think he’s the one that broke the ground. People don’t give a fuck. They love his music so so much. It’s the people that break the stereotypes that make history but I just thought it was interesting to point that out about the fashion world and the music world and just culturally, it’s reverse discrimination.\nLS: How did you feel when you heard that your stepfather was going to transition and become a woman? \nKW: You know the first thing I did think of is I thought about black radio hosts maybe possibly making jokes about it because the black culture is generally so homophobic. News cycles are just constantly… They’re just trying to find some news and some interesting things like, ‘This rapper has this transgender person in his family and…’ But then I was like fuck what people say. Fuck what people think. I feel proud to be in a family that has so many people breaking ground for the generations to come. I just feel like whoa reality show… like that’s so fucking new of an art form to the point where my wife and their family should have had plenty of Emmy’s by now. But reality shows are considered to be like rap was when the Mondrian wouldn’t let Run DMC and motherfucking Will Smith stay there because they were rappers... or the idea of a reality star not being allowed into a fashion show or not being nominated for their show even if it’s the longest running and the most popular and everybody I know watches it and shit. I feel proud that not only my contribution of the credibility that I gained and garnished from music - and just my general social opinions - that I could be next to a wave of thought of this is who I am. And that is all I’m about. Like fuck, to let your life be controlled by public opinion would be like asking to sit in traffic for the rest of your life. Meaning like you want to turn this way but there’s a car right here, you want to turn that way but there’s a car right there, you want to go a bit faster but there’s a car right in front of you, you want to just stop, cars start honking at you. That’s public opinion and Bruce just got off the exit sign and drove as fast as he wanted to. Oh sorry, it’s disrespectful to use that name but I’m still getting acquainted with what’s politically correct because it’s new, it’s modern. This is like Roman times, bro, this time that we have - this 100 years - is really the beginning of the future. We finally tapped into the type of technology and acceptance and thought that we need to... Look at the new pope. It’s a bunch of dope motherfuckers out here that are just pushing towards the future. It’s funny that I went to this train of thought off of Willo’s question because he is one of, if not the most important person in my creative growth. He is my number one instructor. He is the reason why I was able to know who Nick Knight was. He is my greatest home tutor and educator. As I said, I felt like I had the spark in me but Mike Tyson needed a custom model, Hercules needed that little trainer guy in that movie... He is my greatest cultural coach - as far as Helvetica fonts go - and operatic stages and you know honing and training and riding bikes around Paris and analysing and philosophising about you know where the future can go. And the whole idea of Donda and what we do with design and the way we’ve simplified things. Album covers are important again, stage shows are important the signs, long, only sonic outros to songs… This is all like an extension of my times and my trainings with Willo.\nLS: Hundreds of people asked this. Next album: When’s it actually coming? Tell us about the name. What are you trying to communicate with it?\nKW: Well as I said when I first said that name, I wasn’t sure if I was gonna keep that name but I just felt like I didn’t want to walk around with the name So Help Me God for the amount of time I was working on the album. I just felt like that was a heavy backpack to carry. ‘SWISH’ just kind of lightened the load so I could let it be whatever I want it to be. So I could just work on the painting and find something which... actually me and Nick today… He just showed me a piece. I could say the idea but I was really inspired by some things and you can find the purpose through a painting, through a video, through a conversation, through a sunset, through a really tragic headline and it’s like I was collecting these vibes and just things that I liked but the album had no purpose. And it was finding something that’s like, wait a second okay, it can go to something like this, I always wanted to do this. I did Cool Summer because I wanted to shoot surround vision. I had this idea and for people out there who don’t know what surround vision is, I was performing with Jay Z one night on Watch the Throne and I was just looking at how the whole audience were experiencing the performance and I thought of this theatre experience where it was a screen above us, below us, to the left of us, completely peripheral, to the right of us, and three screens in front of us and then we made this gyroscope system and put iPhones on it and recorded some kids running across the street. You saw them on this side, then you saw them in front of you then you saw them on that side. You heard them , you saw the ground below you and you saw the sky above you. Two weeks later, we went to Qatar and shot a film… My idea - because I couldn’t get money from movie houses - I went to Def Jam and said look, I’ll just do an album and the whole point was to get the budget. I was thinking this should be easy, you know, I’ve got all these rappers on my record label and blah blah blah. Then I ended up having to rap on seven songs and taking a while to finish the album. It still has a lot of amazing songs and the idea was I wanted to do an album that’s more commercial on purpose. I want to show that I can make radio songs because before that it was 808 and Dark Fantasy. It was very heavy. I want to show I can do something that’s lighter. I gave you this whole example to say the reason that I did the album was just so I could shoot that film.\nLS: A lot of people are asking about the films and what’s happening with them and when they’re going to get to see them.\nKW: Hopefully, yeah… I’m working on some ideas on how to be able to bring it back. I don’t want to make an announcement yet of when I think I’m bringing Cruel Summer back but we’re working on something right now.\nLS: In a lot of your last interviews, you focus so much more on fashion rather than music. It seems like your album has been delayed because you’re working on your clothing lines. Is fashion your main passion instead of music? Does music not excite you in the way it did a few years ago?\nKW: No, it doesn’t excite me like when I heard Wu Tang. Of course it doesn’t excite me like that. It doesn’t excite me like when I was using auto-tune for my first time. It wasn’t my first time because I did it on College Dropout too. There were things to prove. There were purposes. There was Lauryn Hill and Dead Prez. There was this idea of mixing this kind of messaging meets the hotness of Rockafella and proving that this was a possible thing. I am an inventor. I am an innovator. It’s fine for other people to proliferate on an idea but I get excited by ideas, not by responsibility. So sometimes when I’m even writing a rap, it starts to feel like a big responsibility. If you look at Andre 3000 - one of the top five greatest rappers of all time - the majority of the time, he actually only had to write one verse... so as far as doing three verses, sometimes you start to feel more like you’re doing a talk show every night than doing some type of prophetic, every two year speech. I believe that there’s raps that I had that meant everything and I believe that there’s certain raps that were hot and there was something that meant something about hearing something that was just hot. So I’m not gonna say it meant nothing, but it meant nothing for lack of a better way to describe it, you know. People could want so many things out of you and you don’t want to let people down because of Michelangelo comments and things. You want to deliver genius, you want to prove people wrong, you want to prove people right that are fighting for you. And sometimes creatively because I’m held to task by the highest critics of every genre of art, I feel like I’m one of those guys that hundreds of years ago, they would steal something and their form of death would be to be tied to four horses then they’d whip all the horses at the same time and they’d pull the arms out of their sockets each way. That’s how it feels when I’m getting pressure from all the different angles. It feels like my arms and legs are being pulled out of my body at the same time.\nLS: So there’s no chance the album you’re working on will be your last just to stop a bit of that pressure?\nKW: I’d never call out what would be the last. Id call out what would spark more inspiration. I will think of a philosophy or think of something I want to say. I think hm this would be a great opening line or maybe I want to abstract the way you even hear rap. A lot of people liked the original of ‘All Day’ better than the one that eventually got released and that was so much more like a freestyle but it left things really open which felt more like later Picasso works. Oh yes, as you guys know, I think I’m Picasso also or the closest thing to it. So lesser, equal or maybe even better. Maybe there’s something that’s more Cubist about the way I rap and that’s what I’m trying to find where. It’s like do you really need to paint every angel wing in? Their paintings weren’t completely finished. And here’s another thing. The majority of the things that are popular now are really directly based on something that I’ve done over the past ten years. You can pinpoint it. Like that was that album or that song.\nLS: Does that annoy you?\nKW: I think it’s amazing. I think I had a purpose. That was my purpose: to innovate. So if you hear something that sounds similar to something that I’ve done before, that is an extension of a new album for me.\nLS: So a lot of the people you talk about who you really admire or who you think are talented, do you often see yourself in the work that they’re making?\nKW: Yeah, completely.\nLS: So people you’ve talked about working with or you’ve cited in conversations - Drake, Young Thug, all these different people - do you see that in their work?\nKW: I’m not trying to specify people but I just feel like there is a lot of influence and you can almost pinpoint the moments when things happened. But also, I was heavily influenced by Radiohead and James Brown and Coldplay and Jay Dillon and Jay Z and Tribe and Pharside and Dr Dre or Quincy Jones or Teddy Riley. So all of that was in my work too.\nLS: With your lyrical process, is it important to you that the listener completely understands explicitly what you’re saying, like with each line, or is it better that they just take the abstract emotional gist of the song?\nKW: It totally relates to what I said earlier about finding... You know, I think that abstraction… I wrote this thing down the other day. I hope my words don’t get in the way of how I feel, my meaning. But words, fuck, you know, it’s an extremely powerful tool that can be… I just like abstracting music. I like to listen to Coltrane and say this is amazing. I feel an era of that. I feel a rise of that, possibly coming after so many words.\nLS: A lot of people really relate to specific words. Carl Swaygan said he listened a lot to particular aspects of your music and he talks about suffering from anxiety and PTSD and he said your music has got him through a lot. He asked what gets you through similar things because maybe it’s your own music but he talks about when you’re feeling anxious or you’re feeling down or you’re feeling depressed. What do you turn to?\nKW: I just talk to my wife.\nLS: What did you do before that?\nKW: Talk to my wife. Or talk to my would-be wife. I talk to my friends. I just talk. I get really explicit, you know, with the way that I feel at that time. I’m extremely open. That way, I can sweat the anxiety out. I open up the pores and sweat the anxiety out or sweat what I’m worried about or say, ‘What are we doing? If this is a game or this is a war, how many soldiers did we just lose? What can we do differently to win and to prove everyone wrong?’ I appreciate naysayers. I appreciate non-believers because also sometimes it’s weird for me when people do believe in me. Like someone’ll come up to me and be like, ‘Man, I believe you’re like Basquiat.’ People say stuff like that to me and I’ll just be like, ‘Wait a second, only I can say that about myself.’\nLS: That’s a question that someone asked about the pressure you feel on yourself because things like, ‘I Am A God’, this sense of you being a divine power, does that scare you? Does that freak you out? Lots of people wrote in and they said lovely things like his music’s got me through the hardest time, he stopped me from committing suicide, he stopped me from fucking up my life. But you must feel a sense of pressure from that when people treat you like you are this kind of god to them.\nKW: The reason why I made the song ‘I Am A God’ is so those people that feel less than can turn it up and say it loud and embrace it for themselves, that God is inside all of us. It wasn’t about specifically me. it was about us as a race; that we are an extension of God, that we all have god inside of us.\nLS: One question that came in a lot was: If you could give yourself advice now to when you were dropping out of college, what advice would you give?\nKW: There’s so many things that had to happen for me to be sitting here with you right now. It wouldn’t be truthful for me to give a statement as arrogant as ‘I wouldn’t change a thing’ because when I sit on a long flight to Paris, all I do is wallow in the things that I wish I could have changed, things that I would have tweaked. So as far as the college thing - I don’t seem to wallow on that that much but if you asked me a straightforward question about it, I’d say the more education, the better. The more you know… Well, sometimes you can know too much especially if you don’t have the opportunity to do things and it can drive you crazy. And that’s a bit of what the Yeezus period was like. To know that I was simply not succeeding due to lack of resource, due to lack of assistance, and to have shown so many times that you had an ability but for people to doubt your ability because you’re not playing your position; the position that they want you to play. You’re not tall enough to be centre or something like that.\nLS: What was the scariest moment of your life?\nKW: Probably my car accident. A lot of time, I try to find answers that are like, ‘Mmm I wouldn’t have expected that.’ But yeah, that was pretty scary.\nLS: You talk about luxury and about the only luxury we have being time. What do you spend most of your time doing?\nKW: Working on luxury. That probably is it. I do spend the majority of my time working on my goals to create this creative ecosystem that allows a bunch of ideas to flow through them. I’m sure Nick could probably relate to that. I probably spend the most time on trying to create something that allows me to create everything.\nLS: Thinking about improving the world. One question that made me laugh. It came from Boris Johnson, who the mayor of London. What would you do to make London better?\nKW: Widen the streets, cause they get really scared.\nLS: How do you think your portrayal through lyrics, visual, quotes of the black woman formed pop culture’s understanding of black women? And do you think it is within the function of contemporary black male rappers to uplift their female counterparts in the face of adversity?\nKW: I definitely think generally, rap is misogynistic and it’s just a part of - not saying it’s justifying the culture - I definitely think I’ve said ‘Bitch, get out the car’ in some of my lyrics and stuff like that. And is there a responsibility? I feel like rap, for the 20 years that I’ve studied it, it’s only, as a whole, responsible to trend. So the only way that specifically what she’s talking about would be hurt more if it was more in style. Rap is a communication of trend. It’s a communication of the way people are in real life. It’s a communication of what someone just said to their girlfriend on the phone or an argument they just had or something positive that just happened. What I notice is, there was a time when we had afro-centric rap and everybody was like how common is. It was like ‘my queen, this, that.’ You haven’t even heard the word ‘queen’ so long in that context. What I’ve noticed is when I come home from a meeting with some head of a studio and I just get completely dissed and I show them a bunch of creative things - like on Despicable Me where he was trying to show his mum he could make a rocket and she was like whatever, that’s weak. That’s how it is going to meet with people in Hollywood and showing them your ideas. They just shit on you, like ‘We don’t need that, it’s weak.’ And I’ll come home and I’ll find myself being more irritated and maybe being more rude with my wife. So let’s take that to the idea of a black male in America not getting a job or getting fucked with at his job or getting fucked with by the cops or being looked down upon by this lady at Starbucks and he goes home to his girl and… Just to think about my frustration and if I was rude to my wife because of that, we are like super well off to the point where this guy is like, ‘I can’t take my kids school shopping if I knock my manager the fuck out if he says this to me one more time.’ They cannot drink the Ye juice at all. They cannot turn up at all. It’s like you scream at the person closest to you. This song that Chief Keef put out that I sang the chorus on - I was singing I scream at you cause I can’t scream at nobody else - and then take that and you go to a studio and that frustration and disrespect is now coming out towards the woman next to you or the women around. Like we can’t wife you, you’re just a thot, we can’t do this, blah, blah, blah. And the guys around are just like, ‘You’d better not say that to them or I’ma shoot you.’ It’s from lack of opportunity. It’s from being inside of traffic - that thing I told you earlier - that lack of ability to see a way out and you just start being frustrated inside of that space… and then you go into the studio and that’s what it’s gonna sound like. ‘I’ma shoot you, fuck you, bitch’ because that ‘fuck you, bitch’ came from America. That ‘fuck you, bitch’ came from our lack of opportunities. That ‘nigga, I’ma shoot you’ came from racism which is an amazing tool. It’s like if you could put racism in the battery of your phone, it would never stop working. It works on itself. It’s residual and shit. Residual racism is to be in a racist situation where you’re working at this fucking job downtown blah blah blah, they’re treating you like shit, and you go home and you’re just mad at everybody. It’s like black people don’t even like black people at a certain point. Racism is the hate that keeps on hating. And I said this thing, I was sitting with Steve McQueen when we showed our piece that we did on ‘All Day’ and it we put it in the LACMA. Let me say that again just to purely be a dick because I said that knowing it was a stunt and very intellectual. So me and Steve McQueen… I think it’s a very impressive thing to say shit like that right after saying nigga, nigga, fuck, fuck, wee, wee, wee. I said I just embrace racism. He just looked at me like what the fuck do you mean you embrace racism. I was like no, it’s here. This thing is like we’re in a jail cell. Are we gonna keep fighting this? How do we just embrace what’s in front of us as opposed to always pinpointing that it’s the reason you’re being held back? But I realised in order to truly be one of the greatest artists and one of the most remembered artists - I’ma get off the social subject and switch it more into the art and fashion context again - is that same assistance that I begged for and got frustrated for… The fact that I’m starting to do it without some of that assistance is what makes it truly historical and what demands the respect. And that’s the reason why even in the beginning, there’s like an intellectual olive branch of your show had more meaning than just being an oversized sweatshirt. I refused that intellectual… Get that fucking branch out of my face. I ain’t gonna take it. I ain’t gonna take the meaning that you proposed upon me. This is what i meant and if it’s not good enough for you, then fuck you. My Aunt, one time, she let me see Robocop and my Dad was really strict and I came home and was about to tell him and she grabbed me and said, ‘You’re really a glutton for punishment, aren’t you?’ Almost like a masochist or some shit, right. And like in a way, I am. I kinda like pain, I like the challenge, I like making things harder for yourself because if you can beat the game on the hardest mode possible, you’ll be the best of all time. So that means if I become a good designer as a black straight American entertainer, rich dude, all the type of shit that says you shouldn’t be able to have any creative thoughts, then it’s like the ultimate fucking win. Then you’re like Eminem or Tiger Woods or Barack Obama, just someone who just completely broke all boundaries... And it’s exciting. This interview is exciting because it’s such a battle of perception and a battle of the intellects and a battle of culture and a battle of class, a battle of taste. It’s like y’all motherfuckers know I’m gonna win this battle. It’s so fun though. It’s so fun. Because the whole trick I always say is I’m an artist and an artist can basically take on any shape, form and an artist can paint anything. So when I’m like opening up the Yeezus mountain on tour and stuff with the Margiela mask… you know, some nights in the middle of one of my rants, I’m just like I’m sorry, the gig is up. I was actually never really a rapper, I was always an artist and that’s the reason why I’m just killing this shit so hard right now. So when you talk to the lighting guys, it might not come out as good but don’t feel bad because I’ve been trained since age 5 and went to college for this shit. It’s always like that secret thing, you know. It’s about sharing information. Jews are a culture that share information. That does not happen in the black community. For your family, your son, maybe. Day one, this is how this community works. This is how we grow together. And that racism, slave mentality, nigga mentality, show off mentality, I’ma fuck your bitch mentality, all that is like what makes a culture that has all the highest physical attributes going for it the weakest due to simply - like that speech DiCaprio gave on Django - simply removing the esteem and that is why I refuse to fucking back down. You have to know that you are somebody. You have to know that it’s possible whether you’re creative, whether you’re a black person in America, whether you’re a black person in London, you know, you have to know it’s possible. You have to see me keep winning against all odds. I will win until I die. I won’t lose. I can’t lose because then it’s like they win; ‘they’ meaning the mentality, the old guard of thought because we’re just a thought. A hundred years from now, we’re all just memories.\nLS: Do you feel it’s true all creatives die alone due to lack of understanding? In some ways, what you’re saying, you sound super positive but in other ways, there is that sense of pessimism and people not understanding. Do you think that statement’s true?\nKW: Well, I’ve said a bunch of wild shit and my wife hasn’t left me yet so let’s hope not. But I think there will be someone who will understand everyone. I dont know. Maybe there is a someone for everyone. I’m trying to be overly positive.\nLS: I can’t really think of anything profound that I don’t already know about you… so here’s a really simple question that I actually don’t know. What would your last meal be? \nKW: Oh it’d definitely be some of of her home cooked fried chicken.\nLS: Going back to the women thing, it’s a question I want to know. Would you say you’re a feminist?\nKW: I think I’m a humanist. Is that a party? But yeah, come on, like so many black kids in America, I was raised majority by my Mum. My Dad was around - I would see him in the summers and the springtime. But I think I fight for the importance of any community that is not being properly accredited - just period - of anything. This statement is going to sound kinda gay but I’m gonna say it. I love older white men, but basically if you’re not an older white man, you don’t run shit. It’s always gonna be more of a fight for anyone that isn’t an older white man. Period. So I like to speak on behalf of people without a voice and sometimes that could be a creative, sometimes that could be a woman, sometimes that could be a man turned into a woman. My dad five years ago would live in a homeless shelter to counsel with ex-drug addicts and, you know, he really cares about people. It’s like as soon as he moved to where he is now, he was like how can we improve the water here? How can we improve the education system? I just met this girl. She’s in this situation with her family. This and that. What can we do to improve this? That’s all he cared about. It’s caring about people. So there’s something where it’s like I live my life, I get to be a rockstar, a rapper, this, that, and then at a certain point, it’s at that moment where you just look and you see people dying and being on top of their roof and you just look at the camera and say George Bush doesn’t care about… and that’s like my dad and that’s my mum. I’ll go to a football game and I’ll be looking at the game and I’ll watch the score and I look at the human score meaning like the 50,000 people there and I start to zone in and think like where did this person come from? What did they go through? What type of job have they got? What brought us all here today? What are their interests? It’s like sometimes that part of my dad comes out of me that starts to get really intrigued with who people are. So even when I design, I am going to make the Apple of clothing. I don’t think there’s a purpose of saying you want to do it because it’s obvious I want to… But want is like this politically correct way to word your future accomplishments. This one guy was super snobby with me at a fashion dinner, of course. And I explained to him that there was a time when people said I couldn’t rap and he asked me, ‘Oh, so is this what you hope to do in clothing?’ I was like I don’t hope. I execute. As far as apparel goes, I will make the Apple of apparel and the Apple of apparel isn’t high street. It isn’t fast fashion. It isn’t a $9000 sweatshirt. It’s the thing you want to keep for the rest of your life. Just looking at human beings, sometimes you present things, people don’t even know that they want it yet. I could show you two photographs. I’ll show you a really well-known designer that’s highly respected blah blah blah that I pulled as a reference to proportion because they had this silk jacket. It almost looked like a lining fabric. If I describe it too well, they’ll know what I’m talking about. I don’t want to say the person’s name but it had like denim on denim and like a sock on a shoe and different things like that. It was after I did my sock shoe. And I had a photo I had just done and the guy had an olive jacket on, cotton on cotton, self-lined, a tank top… The colour, I probably couldn’t even describe it, almost an orange but really subtle, and the shorts are like some beautiful light brown with a bit of grey in it and the guy was black that the clothes were on. And everyone who I showed those two images together, now, the one image, you even know who the designer is and it’s top five designers in the game and you see this image right here. And I’m like which one? And people always pick this one because of the colours and people don’t even understand how important colour is as an opinion in clothing. Give a fuck if I got any of the cuts right on the last collection. Anyone who doesn’t say ‘I had an emotional connection to the colour palette’, they don’t even know how to see anymore. They don’t even know what they’re looking at. They see clothes and they’re looking at numbers. They’re not feeling emotion. They’re thinking about trend. They’re not seeing future. They’re not seeing luxury. They’re not seeing time like oh shit, I wanna go to the park with my family. I’ll just throw this on. That’s what I want to do: is present something that gives people some of their time back because it works together like Lego and you just throw it on. And I’m not saying that I mastered it by season 2 for Christ’s sake. I didn’t hit ‘Watch the Throne’ and ‘Dark Fantasy’ on my second mixtape. But the theory is there and only I can do it. Only i care about it that much. Only i have the exact 2 and 3 code in my head. I could say it out loud. I could say oh this army surplus but look at how far we jumped from army surplus in the second season. So just think about where we’ll be by season 3. Look at how far we jumped. Cause I have the code in my head. You have to cut open my head and take my brain and put it on top of some big organisation and you can’t. It’s like completely, you know, that sweatshirt, that T-shirt decision I’m making is a piece of my mum having me at Operation Push at age five, it’s a piece of my dad going to the homeless shelter, it’s a piece of my grandfather having a store where he fixed furniture in the back, it’s a piece of my cousin bootlegging cross colours out in LA, it’s a piece of my Aunt that was the chicest woman that I knew. Even when she had Alzheimers, she would dress better than the entire family and I remember the colours and they remind me of the colours that we were able to find. We were able to start to find and penetrate this concept by the second season without being held back by the fabrics that were available, to do all-black and only have a navy blah blah blah. I don’t use blue. It bugs me out.\nLS: Tell me about the colour blue.\nKW: Yeah, I hate the colour blue. On this collection, Katherine Hamnett was emailing me about how I had to have blue jeans and how I’d need to have a white shirt and this and that about… I was like I guess I could see how I would need that but like I said, I like to make it harder for myself by just doing what I want to do.\nLS: You say you like to make things hard for yourself and you’re so driven and you’re so passionate. You’re obviously ambitious. Are you happy?\nKW: So so so so happy. And I’m happy for the normal reasons to be happy because I married the woman of my dreams and I have a beautiful daughter and so many beautiful people around me and my cousins and families in different states - there’s so many loving people. I have a son on the way. I have a lot of life ahead of me and I have the opportunity to be completely rogue and to be able to support myself being who I am exactly and now I’ve even opened up a whole new place to create by being able to do apparel and then going in and doing film and being able to take those horses that at one point were pulling in all these different directions and pulling my arms out of my sockets and re-aim them in one direction and have the most powerful four horses running towards you; that tsunami about to hit, that earthquake about to come in. Some people might not see it and for the people who don’t see it and don’t understand what’s about to happen, you know, certain people are visionaries, certain people are early adopters, certain people are just followers. So I take it that the most negative reaction is from the followers.",

"trend is always late\nwhen you first wake up dont hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. Its better than any movie.\nYou have the best ideas. Other peoples opinions are usually more distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you dont absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can.\nDont follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.\nI dont believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You dont have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you.\nYou will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then its just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness.\njust stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.\nin life, we are all trained actors. When were born were ourselves and then one of the first things were thought is how to act. If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and cant express himself in a conventional manner\neveryone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to \"the simulation\". Parents are our first acting coaches.\noh by the way this is my book that Im writing in real time. No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write. This is not a financial opportunity this is an innate need to be expressive.\nme and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.\nBe here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see.\nTheres love stories. Pain happiness. Its 3 dementional. Theres taste touch sound. Its the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both.\ntoo much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update.\nCars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. Its amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... its a hoodie 🤷‍♂️\nI find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like \"this person stole this from me\" and the funny thing is itll be a reference I took from somewhere 😂\nlets be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you dont get the credit for them. Lets be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.",

"Well seeing that, I think I, maybe for one of the first times in my life, I understand how it is to feel humbled. I want to say some \"thank you\"s really quick. Thank God for Stephen Hill, who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesnt care about what Ghost somebodys driving or how big somebodys house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic, current, and futuristic black music every day. So, make some noise for Stephen Hill to start this\nSo, since this is pre-taped and the fact that Adam Blackstone used to be my music director, Im pretty sure hes not gonna start the music on me. If I go Chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when I went and visited Minister Louis Farrakhan, and I just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that I had been talking about over the past couple years. And it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. You know, at the barbershop and everything, I used to hear people talking about, \"You know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon go and get a rich black dude.\" But I want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. So it aint got nothing to do with the money\nAnd it takes me back to a story that she told me where her father, Robert Kardashian, walked out, and on the side of his Bentley, they wrote \"Nigga lover\" because Robert Kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got O.J. off. She had never seen her father curse, get mad, he was the most laid back human being. And he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down, and she sat there crying and said, \"Dad why you going so crazy?\" He said to her, \"One day you may have a black child. A beautiful, beautiful, beautiful black child. And its gonna be hard, youre gonna see how hard it is.\"\nSo, true enough, we deal with racism because there are different races, or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races, as opposed to the macro, which is the human race. The bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why Im not allowed to be empowered is because of race, because of peoples perception of celebrity, because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper, but not the idea of becoming an owner. And they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy idea\nHarriet Tubman said she could have freed so many more, and Im sorry mom if that was incorrect English. Harriet Tubman could have freed more if they only knew they werent free. So dont think that because we can afford this custom Balmain suit that were free. And dont think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that were free. And dont think that because its 3% of a gated community that has colored people in it that were free. Its the mentality, the slave mentality, where we all eventually become slaves to that car. Slaves to the perception. Slaves to the idea of being cool\nI thought it was so appropriate the way Wayne Brady kicked his whole shit off tonight. For us to express ourselves. Our power, our oil, since we dont own any oil. Our oil is our expression, is our influence. Dont never let them take that away. And when we have the chance to express it and influence, dont only do it for us, do it for the human race",

Everybody said that if you voted on Trump you have to go back to like Montauk or shit. And guess what? That entire team still put together this show tonight with people with differences of opinion, still put this show together tonight and still came together and made this show for y’all. They told me, “Ye, do not say that out loud. Whatever you do, do not say that out loud.” And I just said it! I wanted to say that before the election and they told me, “Do not say that out loud. Whatever you do, do not say that.” That don’t mean that I don’t think that Black Lives Matter. That don’t mean I don’t think that I’m a believer in women’s rights. That don’t mean I don’t believe in gay marriage.

Why did we boo the first time on something that wasn’t, “Hey, do you like Trump?” That wasn’t what I asked. I asked you to give me your facts because the internet was giving you their facts based on what you wanted to hear and a lot of you guys got blindsided.\nHow that make you think, though? The fact that I just asked that undeniable question? That in most music situations you have the Democrats always since the beginning of time. The Democrats were considered to be more liberal. The Democrats were supposed to be more futuristic in their approach. The Democrats were supposed to have more empathy and be more about the people and that relates directly to music and it also relates to celebrity and the idea of what music does for you. Democrat is like music to your ears or something. Bye. Your voices. Do you believe–what percentage of people here–and by the way, I’m not setting y’all up, I’m not setting y’all up I’ve got no time for bullshit–what I’m saying is, what percentage of people here do you think voted for Trump? Do you think it was two people here? Do you think maybe it was 100 people? Do you think maybe it was 1,000 people out of the 15,000 people here? No, I’m asking you, what do you really believe? One person. Two people. What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe?\nI haven’t talked about anybody’s stances on anything. I haven’t talked about any quote that anybody gave from either side. That’s not what I’m talking ’bout. That’s not what I’m asking you. What I’m asking you is what you really believe. I put something that I would bet on. I bet that it might be 20 percent or maybe even 30 percent of this very audience right here that might have voted for Trump. I bet you 15 percent, 50 percent of them, would never say that at a Kanye West show because of the climate right now. And they don’t know they might think I’m like, “Oh, they voted for Trump... y’all should go ahead and….” It’s the opposite of that. People got the right to vote for whoever they want to vote for. That’s the right to vote! That is our right! I did not vote. Aww, no. The Saint Pablo ticket sales are going down now. Aww no, t-shirts. “Aww nah, you just got out of jail Ye. You had to deal with the Taylor Swift shit for seven years now you gonna go say some... naw, Ye don’t say shit. Just step out.” Fuck that, bro. That’s the reality.\nWell, Ye, how you gonna expect people to vote for you if you ain’t even vote? I’m concerned not about the idea of being president or the actual job of it. I’m concerned about putting our concept of how to do the job in a new way. And if no one will do it in that way I will take position in 2020 and do it myself. “Aw you ain’t gonna get it now because of what you just said.” It was proof that it didn’t matter what nobody just said! It doesn’t matter!\nIt might have been a reporter who wanted to use this as an opportunity to say, “Oh, this rapper” because when they call me a rapper they try to say that I’m less than thinking, less than a philosopher. But rappers are the philosophers of our now. The rappers all form a sense of our now. The celebrities are the influencers of our now. Just look at the president. He wasn’t even in politics and he won! That shows you not if you mad about him winning, but that shows you the level of possibility that is out there if you go and find information and don’t believe everything the fucking internet is telling you! There is possibilities! There’s possibilities inside of books. There’s possibilities when you call grandmother. Motherfuckers be on the internet way more than they calling they mother or they grandmother. To get information that would have you wrong as fuck like everybody knows a couple days ago! Do you ever want to be blindsided like that?\nDon’t trivialize what I was saying when I talked about our president’s approach to the campaign when I said it was entertaining. I don’t think his approach was just entertaining, because that trivializes it, I actually think that his approach was absolutely genius because it fucking worked! Next song.\nOh shit, you threw something at me. Does anyone else wanna throw something at me? But, you know what, I got the power to get that guy kicked out, or whatever, roughed up. No. Stay here. What do you believe? That’s your opinion. Express your opinion, bro. Express your opinion. Thank you. That’s a woman right there saying, “I love you,” after I just said that there was things that I liked about Trump’s campaign. That’s not supposed to happen, right? No! That’s not supposed to happen, right? Case in point. Aw, no. Well, no. I guess we’re not gonna sell out the rest of the tour now. There’s methods, nonpolitical methods to speaking that I like that I feel were very futuristic and that style and that method of communication has proven that it can be a politically correct way of communication. And I fuck with that. You threw something at me! Naw, he wanted me to sign his Yeezy.\nI don’t say 2020 out of disrespect to our president at all. I’m not saying that, “Aw man, that just mean that anybody can win.” That’s not what I’m saying when I say 2020. I’ll just say I got some ideas about the way that we should connect our ideas. And we should use opposite parties that the Republicans, that the Democrats, that everyone that ran that had an idea that people agreed with should be the collective ideas that are used to run the country. And that should mean more. So theres things that Benjamin Carson believes in... that I believe in. I believe that Benjamin Carson should still be a consultant. I think that Hillary Clinton should still be a consultant. I think that Bill Clinton should still be a consultant. Obama said... I think Obama should still be a consultant. It’s that, “Oh, I don’t fuck with your principles so now I’m not gonna give you no information that could help you help all of us.” Make sure this dude that got the Yeezy get his Yeezy back, specifically. Hey, security, get it back.\nMan, and you know what also? I’m not saying this to diss celebrity and that all who are particularly on the Democratic side, that’s cool, I just like... I hate the fact that because I’m a celebrity everybody told me not to say that I loved the debates. I loved his approach. It’d be like white people that’s racist running around saying “niggas” now. If people are racist and they feel more inspired to say how they feel then they exposing themselves, bro. This is what I’m saying. It’s already the beginning of change. Sometimes things that you might think are bad have to happen in order for change to fucking happen. Sometimes you might have to not get your way to really understand what to do in the future to be able to get your way.",

"Connection terminated. Im sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, But Im afraid youve been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You dont even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends.\nAnd to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling thats not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should.\nAnd to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They dont belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so dont keep the devil waiting, old friend.\nMy daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. Its in your nature to protect the innocent. Im sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours, and then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldnt be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldnt save you then, so let me save you now. Its time to rest - for you, and for those you have carried in your arms.\nThis ends for all of us.\nEnd communication.\n*beep*",
"The problem I have with the paparazzi is if they’re right in front of you and you’re like, “Can you please not take a picture of me?” And they’re like, “Dude I’m not really taking a picture,” and they just keep on doing it like they’re talking to me like I’m stupid and stuff, and then, with arm sprints, I’m going to grab the camera, that just happens, and you don’t expect that to happen with a celebrity, cause you think they’re like a museum animal and stuff, but it’s like, don’t shoot the animals, then, maybe, I don’t know.\nWhat’s interesting, though, the problem is that once you do something like that, the word’s out. And these guys know that a shot of you losing your temper is worth ten times more then a shot of you remaining calm. So it’s kind of a no-win situation a little bit.\nWell except for the fact that I’m going to do something about it. You know, I’m going to make a change. I think it’s my responsibility. My mom, she got arrested for being in the sit-ins at age 6. My grandfather drove the first car at the marches leaving out of Oklahoma. My father was an activist, so I think they just like, messed with the wrong celebrity just now.\nRight. Okay so you’re letting them know, leave me alone.",

"EDITING IN PROGRESS\nYeah Kanye!\nYeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy…\nI figured if we were all quiet, I wouldn’t need a mic in here is that true?\nYeah.\nWhat is the number one thing that you guys want to change, because I want you all to ?\n Education.\nAll right, get up here. . I want you to explain what the problem with education is.\nThe problem with education is they don’t stick up for minorities or people who aren’t in …\nHold on one second. What I want you guys to do no one to clap, no one to scream until she says I am done with my point.\nYes sir.\n then explain the issue.\nMy name is Summer . I’d like to say that the issue with education is that it is whitewashed and not only white-washed, it is washed over by whoever is the victor. So that people who are marginalized in any community, not just necessarily people of color…\nI know that we are trained to emotionally react to the points that are said, to say Mm-hmm I feel that\" or \"Mm-hmm, I feel that\". But today, I want you guys to try, not to try, because trying is failing. What I want you guys to do is show how we can have complete silence until she expresses her point completely. And when she is done and says, \"I...I...We have fully expressed ourselves\" because I don’t love the word, I. Which I get the .\nWhen she says, We have completely expressed our point… who is that?\nYou can’t hear? Can we close those two Malcolm X doors in the back?\nYou see where the two exits are? Is it okay to close the doors, but keep them unlocked, while we’re talking? I think it can help with the sound. Moving forward, we will be in rooms where the acoustics will be absolutely incredible because I will be involved in the design.\nSummer…Summer has an expression about education. Summer go ahead, now what I’m saying is no camera flicks, no flashes, no moving, no opening up Doritos bags. All right Summer, let’s go.\nOkay, so the problem with education that I was saying is, people are marginalized, they’re not teaching all of history. They’re only teaching it from one perspective, which is the victors perspective. That’s not always the right perspective and I feel like if we’re able to include other people into the perspective and into the conversation, it’ll teach the generation coming up how to be more inclusive, how to respond to situations. It’ll teach people how to love each other.\nThere’s just so much wrong with education, some people don’t know so many things, not only just in high school, in college, in the jail systems, everywhere. So many people don’t know, after you come out of jail, you still have the right to vote. A lot of people don’t know that. There’s so much wrong with the education that we can’t keep up with…\n, history.\nSummer’s going to speak on police brutality also. She has another expression she needs to make.\nIs that okay with you guys?\nYes!\nWait a second. It doesn’t have to be okay with you guys because I stated that she was going to do that…\nQuiet down for a second because the problem is, we only have made moves that we are generally okay with not understanding that Instagram has been controlling the opinions of what we are okay with.\nYes!\nSo, me as the leader of the free world, its time for the very first round.\nYes!\nInside of the very first rally. I’ve made a decision that Summer is going to express her feelings and information on police brutality. Silence please.\nOkay, so my feelings on police brutality is not everyone should be allowed onto the police force, first of all. So many people are on the police force that shouldn’t be in the police force. They just want to have authority in action and power. Not only that, what he was saying about brainwashing, obviously he’s right. He’s Kanye West.\n social media is brainwashing people, stuff like TikTok. TikTok is brainwashing little kids. People are on here at 3 years old watching TikTok.\nPause, pause. If you guys want to whisper, go outside and talk. We need absolute silence, we need absolute order. That is the only way for this country to be back in order. And for us to have absolute order, respect, dignity, and honor for those that we showed up in here and that are speaking. Summer is talking right now, if you see someone next to you that nudges you or tries to whisper. Hold your hand and say, this person is distracting me from what Summer is saying right now, and we will have them escorted out.\nNow Summer, go ahead.\nSo on the topic of brainwashing, just everything brainwashes us now. Social media, if they want something, they can program it into our minds. TV, social media, literally everything and the state of the nation is just it’s in complete dismay.\nSummer: \nThere’s one cop that feels like everything is okay, there’s one out that feels like everything is in tatters. And I wish everyone can just come together, respect everyone’s opinions. You don’t have to agree with them, but you can always respect their opinion and that’s how I feel. I have expressed what I needed to say.\nKanye West: \nRaise your hand silently if you have another issue that you would like to bring up. I saw your hand first.\nLauren: \nMy name is Lauren McLeod.\nKanye West: \nThis is Lauren McLeod.\nKanye West: \nI understand everyone is excited, it’s a new world. You have someone who is not afraid of anyone and only afraid of God and in honor to God…we have someone who isn’t afraid of anyone and in honor to God and is at a 132 I.Q. genius that literally went to the hospital because his brain was too big for his skull and literally…Absolutely no clapping. That went to Adidas when it was 50 billion dollar organization losing two billion dollars and ended up at 62 billion dollars before COVID that went to the stock market with GAP and whose net worth went from 3.3 billion to 5 billion in 45 minutes. Now, that his friends, I only have one superhero friend right now, who is that? . Okay, so we have one member of the superhero avenger team, so far. So I know that this is an exciting movement, but we’re not excited because if I told you that I bought you a brand new Mercedes Benz and it’s outside, you’d run to the car. But if I was society today, I wouldn’t have the car directly outside, I’d have it on the other side of the street. So you’d get hit by a car trying to run to your new car.\nKanye West: \nAnd that’s what social media…Quiet. That’s what social media does. It gets you excited about things. It gets you turned up about things. It gets you running around and I’m just walk…I don’t know where these bricks come from, but I’m going to use them.\nKanye West: \nWait a second, where did the bricks come from though? Did you put the bricks in the street?\nAudience: \nNo.\nKanye West: \nDid you put the bricks in the street? I’m not talking about the riots, I’m talking about the bricks in the 80s.\nAudience: \nOh.\nKanye West: \nWe’re ready.\nLauren: \nEducation is an important topic. Education…\nKanye West: \nWe have no microphone.. You got it.\nLauren: \nEducation starts everything. Education starts people who are in our police force, in our healthcare force, in our political force. So, if we’re not educated properly, how can we live in America if we don’t even have the education to live in America. I grew up in Tulsa. I grew up right here surrounded by white people. There’s nothing wrong with white people, but you live with a whole different perspective than everybody else. I lived with a whole different perspective than everybody else and we need to change everything, so we can begin to change.\nLauren: \n, with people in our society. And I think healthcare is so important because if people don’t have access to healthcare, how can people live their life? How can you live your life if you don’t feel comfortable going to the doctor’s, don’t feel comfortable going to vote, if you’re not able to go and vote?\nKanye West: \nOkay, so I stubbed my toe. Two years ago. And went to the doctor because you know I’ve got to , I got to take everything quite serious. I’m not just going to take some ointment or whatever, I’m going to go to the hospital. So, when I got there, 5 doctors asked me if I wanted pain medication. At the end of the year, they give out awards for people who have given out the most medication.\nKanye West: \nIn Europe, there’s a higher threshold for pain. I got plastic surgery to try to look young and try to look like I needed to be on TV out in Los Angeles. You heard a small clip of that on TMZ. After getting the plastic surgery, that was a slippery slope to being addicted to Percocet.\nKanye West: \nPercocet released serotonin and endorphins in your mind that are similar to when you have an orgasm and are also a cousin and a sister of heroin. So, basically, some could say I was addicted to a smaller form of heroin. And I would live in this mansion in the state of community with my Maybach and I would drive to Calabasas high as a motherf***er. That’s the one that my dad is sitting at home waiting for Fox News to run that.\nKanye West: \nIt said he was high as a mother-…No, because I went through a process of one thing leading to the next thing, leading to the next thing, leading to the next…No, because the next thing is the same thing. It’s a cycle. It’s the same thing. We are trapped in a loop. We are going to break that trap.\nKanye West: \nUno memento…wait you come here for the next statement…you said can I…who’s the person that said can I ask? You said can I ask something? Okay, you stand up here, I would like for her to finish…”Imma let you finish”\nLauren: \nOkay, well I have a statement about pride and how it’s different…\nKanye West: \nAbout pride.\nLauren: \nYeah, different places in the United States are trying to . I grew up in . I repeat . , they would get in trouble for it, but other people wouldn’t. The same thing happens at school, if you get into a fight at school, some people get in trouble. , dropped out of school and straight into jail. But other schools, you can get into a fight and you’re back in class that day or the next day. It’s not a fair . If we don’t acknowledge that, nothing’s going to change. There’s still white people, black people, every single person , truly acknowledge that there is a difference between ways that we’re raised and the way we experience the world.\nLauren: \nAnd I think, hey we got celebrities. We have Kanye, but we also have so many other celebrities that represent so many people in the United States and its not fair.\nKanye West: \nI understand that there was a very, very hopeful moment that you had to experience for four years when I wore the Trump hat for four years. I’m going to explain to you that Democrats ain’t get sh** for blacks. And the most racist thing that’s ever been said out loud is the idea that if Kanye West runs for president, I’m going to split the Black votes.\nKanye West: \nThis reminded me, what was Samuel L. Jackson’s character in Django? .\nKanye West: \nStephen…Okay, right, right. I’m not trying to quiet your voices actually. So, I don’t want to say that in an improper way, I just haven’t had the time to word it in the most elegant way possible. So, that’s a Stephen move. When Harriet Tubman, well Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people.\nKanye West: \nThe National Basketball Association is not owned by any blacks. Universal Music is not owned by any blacks. Any celebrity that you see talking is not the real power.\nKanye West: \nTalking is not the real power because the real power that I am putting my line on the life today to speak about, you don’t see them. You don’t see the real power. You don’t know who’s putting the Internet near schools just to trap you. You don’t know who’s talking to you. Black women in between the ages of 12 to 21 that follows this person in order to buy this product. You don’t know who’s the head of the boards.\nKanye West: \nIn risk or no risk of losing whatever deal possible, I am not on the board at Adidas. I am not on the board at GAP and that has to change today or I walk away. Because don’t believe that because they put the second woman, not the first on the bus, the first woman…you know that story where I am going right? There was a girl, do you remember her name? Not Rosa Parks. There was a dark skinned woman, what was she 15? 15. She was pregnant out of wedlock, so she couldn’t start the movement. She couldn’t put the bricks in the streets. I don’t know much about George Soros in all honesty. I do not know much about this man, so I will not bear false witness. I need to educate myself more about these. But also these things is, we pinpoint names.\nKanye West: \nWe pinpoint people, we attack each other. We are all equal in God’s eyes. Sometimes, people are controlled by demons. Sometimes, people are controlled by the environment that we are in, but we are all God’s people. There’s no bad people. There are lost people, but we are all God’s people. There’s not left, right, red, blue. That’s why everybody here is purple today. And everyone, I’ve never got next to someone who didn’t get more prosperous because of it. George Soros, I know, know how to make homes in one day. Well, we’re doing the same thing. We’re making homeless shelters, so I would like to meet with George Soros, on that. Mark Zuckerberg would like to bring the Internet into Africa. Okay, well let’s beat Mark Zuckerberg because when you went to Africa, they said no. China is buying land in Africa. Okay, well my deal with Adidas is no longer that I get a 15% royalty, I’m giving them the 15% royalty.\nKanye West: \nWait a second, I don’t want to hear…I’ll let you know when I’m finished with my thoughts. And I would prefer 10, I like multiples of 20, but I’m giving them a 15% royalty, but because of their 15% royalty, it made me into a billionaire. Which could make me, on this piece alone, at 0 tomorrow. But when God calls Moses, he has to leave his comfy job working for the Egyptians and free the people. And the freedom does not come from an election. The freedom comes from you not loading up pornography. The freedom comes from you not taking the Percocet. The freedom comes from you not doubting your brother and your sister. The freedom comes from you putting that gun down and not shooting people at the gas station. It has nothing to do with thos election. It only has to do with God and God’s people. He sent pause\nKanye West: \nHe set pause for us to take a moment and breathe and not TikTok ourselves out. He sent pause for us, now we have a moment to breathe. It has nothing to do with black, white, rich, poor, red, blue, Native American, pilgrim. It has to deal with being truthful to what God has.\nKanye West: \nI see you have your hands up, walk up here, you’re going to get your chance…yes you, young lady walk up here.\nKanye West: \nNow let me tell you something, I heard you. All right, let me tell you…I’ll talk about Planned Parenthood. So…one more minute sir we can talk. I’m going to have my talk and then I’m going to do Planned Parenthood.\nKanye West: \nSo… most likely speak Spanish here. No… we’re going to be most original languages and we, all these people,. So, and there are illegal, so called…, there’s no such thing as an illegal immigrant. People have been working here and supporting the world, then they need the opportunity for the freedom and the state of a…for the country that they’ve worked for. Let me go to Planned Parenthood.\nKanye West: \nThe statement is, in the Bible, its says Thou should not kill. I remember that my girlfriend called me screaming and crying and I was just thinking. Because at that time I was a rapper, I was out there, I had some girlfriends and everything and I just thought to myself I want to word this in a way that, hey I don’t give a f***, I’m going to word it like .\nKanye West: \nSo my girlfriend called me and I just thought to myself, please don’t tell me I get it that sh** AIDS, that’s going to be rude. Quiet down. Then she said, I’m pregnant. And I said, yes, and then I said, no.\nKanye West: \nSo, I’m going to tell you what was in my mind. She was crying, she said I just came from the doctor, and said Oh my God . Because I was having like a rapper’s lifestyle. So, she said she was pregnant and for one month and two months and three months, we talked about her and I having this child. She had the pills in her hand. You know these pills, that if you take it, it’s a wrap, the baby’s gone. So, I was sitting up in Paris and I had my leather pants on.\nKanye West: \nYou already know if you got leather pants on, you already know who this person must think they are, right? And I’m in the apartment where my wife was actually robbed and I had my laptop that got all of my creative ideas. I got my shoes, I got my sound cover, I got communities, I got clothes, I got all this and the screen was black and white. And God said, If you f*** with my vision, I’m going to f*** with yours. And I called my wife and she said we’re going to have this baby. I said we’re going to have this child.\nKanye West: \nI know people who are 50 years old that didn’t have children. They didn’t have that child. That have never got to experience the level, the level of joy that I’ve experienced in having a child. So even if my wife were to divorce me, after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn’t want to. She stood up and she protected that child.\nKanye West: \nYou know who else protected a child? Who do you think might’ve protected a child? 43 years ago, who protected a child? My mom. My mom saved my life. My dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would have been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy.\nKanye West: \n.\nAudience: \nWe love you Kanye.\nKanye West: \nI almost killed my daughter. I almost killed my daughter.\nKanye West: \nAnd then they said to me, You can’t, you can’t tell them about this story, you’re going to lose your drop deal. They made me put a deal over my daughter. They made me put an Adidas deal over my daughter. They’re going to run this. They’re going to try to tell you that I’m crazy, the world’s crazy. I love my daughter.\nKanye West: \nMy idea…no, no, no. Everyone quiet down. No more Plan B, Plan A. Anyone who is pregnant, you have an option of $50,000 a year that I will support with the organizations that I make, to take care of the child. You have the Plan A option. Are you saying no, you can’t have a Plan A option?\nAudience: \nNo.\nKanye West: \nCalm down everyone. Calm down. Everyone be quiet.\nSpeaker 1: \nWhat about women who got raped? What about women with mental illness? What about our right to take care of a kid? You want them to take care of a kid? Are you, is that what you’re proposing? $50,000 a year for what? For a crazy lady to take care of a baby?\nKanye West: \nNow everyone be quiet so you can hear us. . Steve Jobs is adopted. You are adopted. You are adopted. It actually, the whole thing is villages. It takes a village to raise a child. No matter how much money you have, you need grandmothers, you need friends, you need people.\nSpeaker 1: \nSingle moms with no family. Single moms…\nKanye West: \nExactly. Because the society has been set up for single moms to not have a village, to not have a job. . How many people have to drive 45 minutes to get to their job here? So, I moved to a small town in Cody, Wyoming where people can walk. A four-year-old can walk from school to home safely. We, there’s a lot of policies that only relate to what Rockefeller, du Pont, and Cotton set up. You understand what you guys are talking…you guys might want to say in front of me, f*** you Kanye. You realize that I am putting my life on the line for the truth. Right now.\nAudience: \nYes.\nSpeaker 1: \nKanye, I love you. . You are one of the most creative guys on planet Earth, but I also disagree with you on Planned Parenthood. I don’t think we should get rid of Plan B. I don’t think we should get rid of abortions.\nKanye West: \nLet me tell you. The Bible says…\nSpeaker 1: \nThe Bible says a lot of things. The Bible says a lot of things. Jesus had 12 male disciples and that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute..\nKanye West: \nWhen I said I had….. Amber Rose. People told me to not date this woman because she was a stripper. There was a lot of comparison to Mary Magdalene. We went to the Vatican together and there was a painting by Raphael and the Christian community might not like this, but there was a smudge next to Jesus at The Last Supper. And the person who showed the painting said, that was Mary. And Amber Rose saw that and started crying. She saw that, that the church tried to erase those who weren’t good enough as they saw it in the world.\nKanye West: \nAmber started crying when she saw that. That’s what I mean by that. Jesus loved all people. And when people talk about profanity and different things and God wants us to create is what I’m saying. But in the state that we live in right now, we eat meat, I hunt meat. In the Garden of Eden we didn’t have to. In this state right now if someone is raped in the…I understand why someone would make the choice of getting a divorce. I mean getting a divorce , I mean of getting an abortion.\nKanye West: \nI understand if a person, if a father, is not there. And I’ll be done with this point in about two minutes, let me get it out. I understand if a person is in an impoverished community, why, or if they are impoverished they can’t afford their fifth or sixth or their seventh child, or even their first child. I understand the situation that someone would be in. God would still make it rain. God will make it rain and those people who have never met someone who has said, I had this child and it was the worst thing.\nKanye West: \nPeople always say, God made a way. I had this child and it was the best thing. Society has set it up in a way where we feel that God won’t make a way. When I was 53 million dollars in debt, I was in the crazy home and as soon as I say Jesus name out loud, he gave me increase. He gave me a platform, he gave me sanity, he gave me clarity to be able to speak not on the word of Yeezus and Yeso like in a rap, but on the word of Jesus and community and family. So what I’m saying is, we understand, we’re not going to go back to women having to go in an alley and do crazy type of things. We understand the conditions. We understand the conditions of black people in America and why we break every store that’s there. We understand the conditions.\nKanye West: \nBreak every store that’s there. We understand the conditions of women in America. We understand that we live in a white supremacist world, and until that is equalized, people stand on rights that make them more equal. The idea of a woman having a choice, I understand because it says “Hey, I can do this stuff.”\nKanye West: \nWhen a black man breaks, gets mad, raps, plays ball, wears gold chains. I got gold teeth. My bottom teeth are removed for my gold teeth, and partially it’s because I can do that. So I understand the risk. And here goes the liberals, “He compared abortion to gold teeth.” Hey, let me explain something to liberals, though.\nGeorgia: \nWhat are you? Nothing? \nKanye West: \nI am Christian, but also I am a listener. You cannot lead without listening. This is the reason… What’s your name? This is the reason why Georgia, where I was born, must express their self. People saw me put up a tweet where I showed the six month baby.\nSpeaker 2: \nWhy’d you delete it?\nKanye West: \nBecause I was pressured by the forces that were around me. Now what I’m saying is, I’ve even heard that they can abort a baby up to eight months, but I wanted to show everyone… In the same way when I got into a car accident, and I showed a picture of my face, I wanted to show everyone exactly what the six month baby that is legal to be destroyed in looked like. And then I got social media backlash. Bot, I backstroke the backlash.\nKanye West: \nWhat I want to say is, I understand with where we are today, why if a woman was raped, why… You see, but the thing is, let me give you an example. Women love My Body, My Choice. That is a great example. Does anyone know TMZ.\nSpeaker 2: \nF*** TMZ!\nKanye West: \n quiet down, right? So let’s say when the baby is conceived, at that point it is a soul. It is a real, living thing. That six month year old baby, that’s a real living thing. Do we agree that that was a real baby? That six month old baby?\nAudience: \nYeah.\nKanye West: \nOkay, so My Body, My Choice. Say we were to separate with the baby’s mama and y’all had an argument, and you got a one year old. Be like, basically um, 18 months older than the tweet I sent out. Y’all get in an argument and she says, “My house, my choice. I’m going to kill your child.” You know what I’m saying? Because when a baby is accepted, it is real. It is real at that point, says I. I don’t give a f*** if I win presidency or not. You know what I’m saying? I’m not here to .\nKanye West: \nI care that it’s homeless people in front of the Gucci store. I care that it’s people that are put in situations where they will never know how much because the way society sets things up. I care about these things and I am in service to God. I don’t know, I’m like an employee this weekend. Nothing will happen to me because God has the plan for us, as his people, to be finally free. \nKanye West: \nHow do we disobey? When we kill, we disobey. How else do we disobey?\nSpeaker 2: \nWhen we steal.\nGeorgia: \nWhen we lie.\nKanye West: \nWhen we steal. How else?\nGeorgia: \nWhen we lie.\nKanye West: \nLie.\nAudience: \nCheat.\nKanye West: \nWhen we cheat. When we not love our neighbor. These are these things. Politics, America, Trump, Biden, nor Kanye West can free us. The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land. I don’t think the last… a woman who stood up here and we have the perspective of so many women in the world. You get the last word.\nAudience: \n Talk up! \nKanye West: \nWait, wait, wait. Everybody, if everyone just got quiet while Georgia talks, this would be over right now. And if this is over right now, guess what else is over right now? I’m over. And if I’m over right now, guess what else is over. The country’s over right now. Everyone pay the same respect to Georgia that you paid to me. She openly opened up to you guys, to me, on a platform and said she had an abortion a few months ago. And her maternal instincts were that she wanted to have the baby, but she felt she couldn’t support the baby on $9 minimum wage.\nGeorgia: \nI just think my . I don’t think we should say .\nKanye West: \nLet me explain something to you guys. My stance is not to make abortion illegal at all. It should always be legal, but there should be an option of maximum increase for . Abortion should be legal, because guess what? The law is not by God even. So what’s legality? 30 states still execute men that did not do the crime that they are being executed for, and modern day mass incarceration is slavery. In 2020, abortion should be legal, but the option of maximum increase should be available. \nKanye West: \nMaximum increase would be everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars, or something like that. Oh, wait, wait. Says the person that’s worked five . We would fund it from other countries. With other continents. There are Israeli continents that you do not believe. There are African continents that, the African continent, the continent of Africa. Israel and Africa that would fund a concept like this. \nKanye West: \nWhen you put an idea out. I remember I was supposed to do a couple songs at the MTV Awards, right? And then I said, “Bro.” And then what else did I say? I said, “Listen to the , bro. Listen to the kids, bro.” And are we running in 2020?\nAudience: \nYep. Yeah.\nKanye West: \nOkay, so tell me this. If you had had the opportunity to be given a million dollars just for being pregnant, would you have considered? And then everybody would start making children? The greatest gift of life? Maybe there would be a million children on this f***ing beautiful place? But wait a minute, calm down, calm down. So she’s saying I don’t have the funding… Wait a second. Be quiet for a second, please. I do not have the funding for it, but I have the platform to present the idea for those who do. \nKanye West: \nLet me elaborate on that. But the thing is, the first thing I said was, “I’m about a thousand dollar stipend,” but that’s not going to work because I just listened to what Georgia said. Georgia said, “Okay, this person is mentally ill. This person is .” Then I went into the designing community and said that it takes a village to raise a child. It’s not simply a money situation; it is a people situation. It is a heart situation. It is a spirituality situation. It is a God situation. It is a family situation. Money can’t fix things. Money’s not even real. Is bit coin real? Does the gold back the money? At what point can someone just pressed delete and turn the lights out, all the electricity? Did you guys seen New York go dark? Did you guys see World Trade Center go down? Did you guys see all jobs stop for six months? So no one can tell me what God can’t do and what God will do. \nKanye West: \nOne second, one moment. He was waiting. We got five minutes. wait a second. You need to hear this. this woman was sent by God and is so brave to be able to tell you her story. The fact that she was willing to stand up in front of all of you guys and tell you she had an abortion, to make the point of how important it was for her to have the option as a woman because she did not have the resources in order to have a baby as she felt. This woman is so brave. Georgia, can we make a hand for Georgia right now?\nKanye West: \nWe got, we’re going to have to, you’re very . Come up here, you’re third. I’ve got five minutes. I apologize, guys, but we have all the time in the world. We have all the questions. Wait a second. I must that I did smoke a little bit last night. Every women or man who are charged with marijuana will be free. Light up right now. Wait a second. We have five more minutes. You’ve been waiting on this stage for about 17 minutes. What’s your name, sir? Gary, you’re waiting. Gary, Indiana, we about to bring that Michael Jackson’s home. Oh, I’m sorry. \nAudience: \nI love Michael!\nKanye West: \nOh, do we still love Michael?\nAudience: \nYeah! \nKanye West: \nDo y’all love Cosby? Y’all love Bill Cosby?\nAudience: \nYeah! \nKanye West: \nBe quiet. He’s talking about opioids.\nGary: \nI want to talk about opioids and .\nAudience: \nSpeak up!\nGary: \nIt’s like the treatment. We’re addicted to the treatment.\nKanye West: \nAnd by the way, we’re getting addicted to the treatment of the endorphins. Hey, how many times y’all looked up what y’all likes are when you post something? That’s a form of treatment. Y’all getting treated. In Chicago, we call that “getting treated”. When y’all get to comment number eight, who is that person? You don’t even know who that person is.\nAudience: \nNobody!\nKanye West: \nThat’s the person that’s influencing you, because when you hear bad things about yourself, about a photo, it make you want to up the photo. You want to Photoshop it. You want to \nGary: \nI’m saying we’re addicted to the treatment. They’re trying to .\nKanye West: \nWhat I said, this is the solution to make it more, to have more money. Big pharms. We just need to make big pharms. There’s a solution for big pharm. There’s a solution with that. I tell you this, I’m not going up against big pharm; I would die. They would kill me. But I tell you this, sitting next to them, I would make them more money. I would make them more prosperous, but we got to do it in a way where we balance holistic and modernity. Okay, Aisha’s comment is on gun violence in the United States. I live on a 4,000 ranch and I can shoot AR15s all day, day, day, night without going to jail and it feels weird because I grew up in Chicago.\nKanye West: \nBecause I grew up in Chicago where if you use one of the guns, that was strategically placed in your community for you to get locked, you will end up going to jail. I was talking to a fellow billionaire, and he talked about…no I don’t want to use his name. Hey bro, I told you I ain’t finna use his name. You told me to use his name. You think I work for you?\nKanye West: \nNo that’s what I’m talking about. I told…don’t step up but what’s your name? Tell the people what your name is. .\nKanye West: \nHey, guess what? Jesus saved the name. I’ll tell you what.\nKanye West: \nReal talk. Real talk. Young violence. I tell all my friends I know a place where you can shoot guns for free. Shooting guns are fun. .People are getting guns at age six. If you guys put down all your weapons, what happens if other countries and all media and all China…I actually couldn’t say. When other countries come in and you have no weapons, what do you think is going to happen? We are slaves. These random women know how to fire a firearm. They are trained to do this. Guns don’t kill people. People kill people.\nKanye West: \nWhen I talked to the billionaire…it was another white man I got to be specific. When we moved to the inner cities it was because of the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution is over with now. It’s time to move again. If you have agriculture as your business, you get taxes breaks. Tesla, the original Tesla said that earth is a giant generator. God has given us freedom. You can feed your family and survive off of earth, wind, fire and through proper engineering. But the education and the schools and these textbooks that have been given to you, have you ever got a textbook that said “Okay you can buy a hundred acres for a hundred thousand dollars in middle America and you can farm and feed your family?” Has there ever been a class on that? But guess what? There’s a reason…would you agree that there’s a reason why there’s never been a class on that?\nKanye West: \nBecause ever time I talk, you’re directly behind me saying something. What I’m saying is, what I ask for specifically is that when you talk, you talk all the way through. When Kerry talks, he talks all the way through. What I’ve told you, the whole time I’m talking to a hundred people, two hundred…it started with a hundred people it’s down to people. And every time that you make a comment .\nKanye West: \nAnd you are adding to the attention of them not understanding . That’s what I’m asking you. His name is Shiloh, you want to speak up? Are you done with COVID, okay?\nShiloh: \nI have two questions. Two quick questions. First question, I want you to elaborate on the free of slaves and how . Second question, you believe so strongly in the bible, how do you think about .\nKanye West: \nI will start the meeting once everyone is completely quiet. Two questions. You got two questions bro, put your hands down. Put your hands down. I’m going to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 10 minutes ago. These are good questions. Put your hands down. Put your hands down. I hear you questions. I heard you sir. You don’t think I know how to listen? . No they know everyone’s irrelevant around me. I heard you the first time. No, no. She got some problems. I heard you the first time. No you don’t gap me. On God.\nKanye West: \nI appreciate that. I got two major, awesome, incredible…you… disrespecting .\nKanye West: \nYou know what…you know what’s so funny? . We always so concerned about how skinny we are. That’s how I got plastic surgery. We always concerned about how good we speak English when it’s not our original language. We always concerned about how good we look and not embarrassing each other in front of an all white country that we work for. And don’t own anything in it. You stay looking bad…I believe we’re all beautiful. It’s not about how we look. It’s about our hearts. It’s about what’s in our souls.\nKanye West: \nNow, pause for a minute. If I was Trump I would have called you sister soldiers or something. But that’s not my vibe. Pause for a minute. You are the planned person that was sitting here like at TMZ to f*** my rally up. Be quiet.\nKanye West: \nI’m trying to answer a question and you are doing what the guy did to me at TMZ. You want to be that same person? And your face is covered so we don’t even know who you are.\nKanye West: \n400 years is related to the bible. African American slavery. Slaves to Hebrews and the Egyptians. But we use that term loosely. Like we say “Jesus” anytime we want. But we got educated, we’re going to have to understand that we need to educate ourselves about what that means.\nKanye West: \nYou probably with the press out there. You probably one of them. Hey, somebody go grab him, and take him out.\nKanye West: \nGive me a second to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 20 minutes ago. Now the thing is, I am not going to pacify you with things that I do not believe in. But I will not put laws on things that you do believe in, but you don’t have no other opportunity to do anything else. I am not that kind of Christian. Jesus loved everyone. Jesus loved gay people. Jesus loved everyone. There’s a lot of Christians that feel like oh Jesus is against gay people. How could Jesus be black church. That’s some true sh**.\nKanye West: \nEverybody’s family…everybody has everybody. Everybody’s got some holier than thou worth. . Everybody got that one uncle that go to the money, the viral. Everybody got the one uncle that was touching the kids. Everybody got the one uncle…everybody. Everybody’s family…we all are imperfect human beings . Jesus loves everyone. He does not discriminate against anyone. Now the Harriet Tubman thing is, I’m sick of this black iconography being used by white organization for us to look up to and say “This is us.” I do not…I own 100% of the Yeezy trademark, but up until now Adidas was getting 85%. And now after this, they either out of business with me or they going to get 10%. I decided not to not make it 15. I decided to make it 10.\nKanye West: \nThat was extremely good. That was extremely bad. I’m going to win in 2020. Out.",

"Announced today, Kanye West‘s creative house DONDA enters into partnership with Roc Nation to manage all DONDA Music\nThe partnership will focus on Mr. West’s international recording brand and worldwide touring ventures\nA multi-discipline design and content company, DONDA saw its early beginnings seeded by the 2009 footwear collaboration with fashion house Louis Vuitton. That collaboration spurred demand for Mr. West’s design sensibilities with fashion and apparel brands around the globe, including Nike and Adidas. DONDA continues its influence in the world of apparel: two versions of the Nike AIR YEEZY – each of which has sold out worldwide in just minutes – two celebrated capsule lines with Parisian brand A.P.C. – also instantly sold-out – and the highly-anticipated new line with Adidas, slated to debut this fall\nMr. West officially branded DONDA in 2011 with the groundbreaking packaging and tour design for Watch The Throne. The following year, DONDA conceptualized and introduced an immersive new way to experience cinema: the 7-Screen Surround Vision experience in Cannes, France. The short film Cruel Summer, a visual companion to the G.O.O.D. Music album of the same name, employed the new techniques in both filming and viewing. In 2013, DONDA oversaw the concept and design for Mr. West’s minimalist YEEZUS album packaging and groundbreaking global launch, including a guerilla-marketing campaign, the “New Slaves” projections. DONDA is at the center of concept, design and production of Mr. West’s lauded concert experience, the YEEZUS TOUR. DONDA has designed and produced album packaging, staging, music videos and content for Lil Wayne, 2 Chainz, Big Sean, Pusha T and more\nFounded in 2008, Roc Nation is a full-service entertainment company, inclusive of artist, songwriter, producer and engineer management; music publishing; touring & merchandising; film & television; new business ventures; and a music label. It is home to a diverse roster comprised of critically acclaimed recording artists, writers and producers including Rihanna, Shakira, Rita Ora, J. Cole, Timbaland, etc. Roc Nation has a partnership with global management company, Three Six Zero. Over the past several years, Roc Nation has been responsible a state-of-the-art recording and distribution deal with the Universal Music Group for JAY Z, Rihanna, and others; Rihanna’s rise as a huge global touring brand; and the launch of the Roc Nation Sports agency, which in its first year has built a roster of such all-star talent as Robinson Cano, Kevin Durant, Victor Cruz and more",

"2016, Edited VersionKanye: OK, dope. You still got the Nashville number?\nTaylor: I still have the Nashville area code but I had to change it\nKanye: For all my south side niggas that know me best, I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.\nTaylor: Im, like, this close to overexposure.\nKanye: Oh well this one is, uh — I think this is a really cool thing to have.\nTaylor: I know! I mean its like a compliment kind of.\nKanye: What I give a fuck about is just you as a person, and as a friend.\nTaylor: Thats sweet.\nKanye: I want things that make you feel good. I dont wanna do rap that makes people feel bad.\nTaylor: Um, yea. I mean, go with whatever line you think is better. Its obviously very tongue in cheek either way.\nTaylor: And I really appreciate you telling me about it, thats really nice!\nKanye: Yea. I just felt I had a responsibility to you as a friend. I mean, thanks for being so cool about it.\nTaylor: Aw, thanks! Yeah I really appreciate it. Like, the heads up is so nice!\nTaylor: …things without like even asking or seeing if Id be OK with it. And I just really appreciate it.\nTaylor: Id never expect you to tell me about a line in your song.\nTaylor: And then the flowers that you sent me, I Instagrammed a picture of them and its the most Instagram likes Ive ever gotten.\nKanye: Relationships are more important than punchlines, you know.\nTaylor: Yea. I mean, I dont think anybody would listen to that and be like, Oh, thats a real diss. Like, she must be crying about…\nTaylor: You gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it. Like you honestly didnt know who I was before that.\nTaylor: It doesnt matter if I sold 7 million of that album before you did that, which is what happened. You didnt know who I was before that.\nTaylor: … that I can make these things happen and I have the ideas to do it and I create these things and concepts. And, like, Im always gonna respect you.\nTaylor: And Im really glad you had the respect to call me and tell me that as a friend, about the song. Its just a really cool thing to do, and a really good show of friendship. So thank you.\nKanye: Thank you too.\nTaylor: And you know, if people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, Look, he called me and told me about the line before it came out. Like, jokes on you guys, were fine.\nTaylor: You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade. But right after the song comes out Im gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and theyre gonna ask me about it and Im gonna be like, he called me.\nTaylor: …awesome that youre so outspoken and its gonna be like, Yea, she does, it made her famous! Its more provocative to say, Might still have sex.\nTaylor: …its not. It doesnt matter to me. theres not one\nthat hurts my feelings and one that doesnt.2020 LeakKanye: —old school s—, yeah. I’m doing great. I feel so awesome about the music. The album’s coming out Feb. 11. I’m doing the fashion show Feb. 11 at Madison Square Garden and dropping the album Feb. 12, that morning. It’s like …. yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Aw thank you so, so much. Thank you. It feels like, real. I don’t know, just ‘Ye, Apple, Steve Jobs-type music. Like, so my next single, I wanted you to tweet it … so that’s why I’m calling you. I wanted you to put the song out.\nTaylor: What would people … I guess it would just be, people would be like, “Why is this happening?” And I had something to do with it, probably.\nKanye: The reason why it would happen is because it has a very controversial line at the beginning of the song about you.\nTaylor: What does it say? \nKanye: It says, and the song is so, so dope, and I literally sat with my wife, with my whole manager team, with everything, and try to rework this line. I’ve thought about this line for eight months, I’ve had this line and tried to rework it every which way, and the original way that I thought about it is the best way, but it’s the most controversial, so it’s gonna go Eminem a little bit, so can you brace yourself for a second?\nTaylor: Yeah…\nKanye: Okay, alright. It says—wait a second, you sound sad.\nTaylor: Well, is it gonna be mean?\nKanye: No, I don’t think it’s mean.\nTaylor: Okay, then let me hear it.\nKanye: Okay, um … and the funny thing is when I first played it and my wife heard it, she was like “Huh? What? That’s too crazy, blah, blah, blah.” And when Ninja from Die Antwoord heard it, he was like, “Oh God, this is the craziest sh—! This is why I love Kanye,” that kind of thing. It’s like my wife’s favorite f—ing line. I just wanted to give you some premise of that, right?\nTaylor: Okay.\nKanye: So it says, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex.” \nTaylor: That’s not mean.\nKanye: Okay. Yeah, well, this is the thing why I’m calling you because you got an army. You own a country of motherfucking two billion people, basically, that if you felt that it’s funny and cool and like hip hop and felt like, you know, just The College Dropout and the artist like, ‘Ye that you love, then I think that people would be like way into it, and that’s why I think it’s super genius to have you be the one that says, ‘Oh, I like this song a lot, like, yeah, whatever. This is cool. Whatever, it’s like, I got like s— on my album where I’m like, “I bet me and Ray J will be friends if we ain’t love the same bitch.”\nTaylor: Oh my . I mean, I need to think about it because you hear something for the first time, you need to think about it because it is absolutely crazy. I’m glad it’s not mean though. It doesn’t feel mean, but like, oh my God, the build-up you gave it. I thought it was gonna be like that stupid dumb bitch, like, but it’s not. Um, so I don’t know. I mean, the launch thing, I think it would be kind of confusing to people, but I definitely like, I definitely think that when I’m asked about, of course I’m gonna be like, “Yeah, I’m his biggest fan. I love that. I think it’s hilarious,” but um, I’ll think about it.\nKanye: Yeah, you don’t have to do—you don’t have to do the launch and retweet. That’s just an extra idea that I had, like, but if you think that that’s cool, then that’s cool. If not, we are launching the shit like on just GOOD Fridays, on Soundcloud, the site, shit like that.\nTaylor: You know, the thing about me is like, anything that I do becomes a feminist think-piece, and if I launch it, they’re gonna be like, “Wow,” like this thing—like they’ll just turn it into something that … I think if I launch it, it honestly like, it’ll be less cool ‘cause I think if I launch it, it adds this level of criticism, ‘cause having that many followers and having that many eyeballs on me right now, people are just looking for me to do something dumb or stupid or lame, and it’s like almost … I dont know, like I kind of feel like people would try to make it negative if it came from me. Do you know what I mean?\nKanye: Yeah.\nTaylor: I try to be super self-aware about where I am, and I feel like, I feel like right now I’m like this close to overexposure.\nKanye: Oh, well, this one is uh, I think this is a really cool thing to have.\nTaylor: I know, it’s like a compliment, kind of .\nKanye: I had this line where I said—and my wife really didn’t like this one because we tried to make it nicer. So I said, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” and my wife was really not with that one. She was way more into “She owes you sex,” but then the owe, the owe part was like the feminist group-type s— that I was like, “Ahhh.”\nTaylor: That’s the part that I’m kind of—I mean, they’re both really edgy, but that’s the only thing about that line is that it’s like gonna … Its just, the feminists are gonna come out, but I mean, you don’t give a fuck, so…\nKanye: Yeah, basically. Well, what I give a fuck about is just you as a person and as a friend. I want things that make—\nTaylor: That’s sweet.\nKanye: —you feel good. I don’t wanna do rap that makes people feel bad, like of course like I’m mad at Nike, so people think like, “Oh, he’s a bully. He ran on stage with Taylor.

"I got off the phone with this one dude. I guess he used to run a multi-billion dollar company or something like that and he had some advice for me, right. He said, I dont approve of your methods in your interviews lately. He said he only saw one person before who ever really pulled this off and that was Muhammad Ali. But he said if he could just give me some advice, he doesnt approve of the way Im going about things as of late. And when anybody thats supposed to have a lot of money talks to me and they give me advice, I call that free advice, because theyre trying to tell me what to do and they aint cut no check yet. If I look to the side of me, or the other side of me, or if I look to the Internet or if Im reading, and I dont see somebody that 36-years-old that made it this far with nobody that told they couldnt do it this much. Because the people that give me advice... I dont see them rocking for 15,000 motherfuckers in Brooklyn tonight. And I dont know if yall have heard of Tesla, and Im not talking about the car, Im talking about the inventor. Or if yall ever heard about Jodorowsky, the director who made Holy Mountain. But theres so many amazing creative inventors who werent recognized in their time. And if Ive got the voice and Ive got the opportunity to turn up in these interviews, I just have to look and say, What do I have to lose? What do I have to lose? We only have everything to gain. So dont ever let them make you think for one moment that Im going insane. Because I sit back and see shit and think Am I the only one thats not crazy? But every celebrity is so goddamn scared of losing everything, that they wont ever say nothing to you. And yall see that shit too. I gotta keep it so true for you... Because when I say creative genius, Im not saying that as a compliment to myself. Im saying that because its a burden to myself when these ideas keep me up at night. When you wanna give the world more and your ideas keep you up at night. When you wanna give the world so much more, so much more. And then nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. And nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. Theyd rather see the headline and be on some bullshit than to give me one little chance. Than to give me one little, little, little chance. Than to give me one little chance despite the advance out of Teslas basement, despite the advance out of me saying Jodorowskys name and yall dont know who the fuck he is when everybody copied off of him... And theres gonna be motherfuckers in this arena in a few months dancing all sloppy off of him...I love yall so much you dont even understand. Because yall help me to talk all this shit. Because when I be on the phone with these people that used to run companies and theyre trying to tell me how to be me, yall give me the power to talk my shit. And I swear to you, this is only the motherfucking beginning. And anybody who , Oh, hes the best of rap. Thats racist. And thats pigeonholing. Thats pigeonholing. Thats pigeonholing and putting motherfuckers in a box. And putting creative niggas in a box. If you believe you can do anything, please raise your hands up tonight. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands in the sky. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands so high. And I wish you could see my tears right now. Put your hands up high. I wish you could feel my pain right now. Cause these dreams keep me up at night. Cause these dreams keep me up at night. These dreams keep me up at night. Dreams keep me up at night",

"Lyrics from Snippets\nWhile youre fast asleep\nDo you experience nervousness or shakiness inside, faintness and dizziness? The idea that someone else can control your thoughts.

"Kanye West and his creative enterprise DONDA have officially launched the GOOD Music Merchandise online store featuring multiple designs on everything from socks to snapbacks. After recently opening the Yeezus Tour Pop-Up Shop , Yeezus has dropped a whole new line of merchandise in support of his record label and newest enterprise in DONDA. The GOOD Music merchandise online store features all black and white items and some of the merchandise has even been worn by Yeezy himself.\nRecently, West spoke in an interview with Power 106s Big Boy Neighborhood denouncing high-fashion company Louis-Vuitton claiming their prices were \"too extreme.\"\n\"If I had the opportunity to design for Louis Vuitton now I wouldn’t, because the prices are just too extreme,” said West. “I don’t want to use my message to have kids saving up that much to be a part of what the ideas are. That’s the problem to me with luxury.”\nWests desires to keep prices more affordable and \"less extreme\" shows in his recent ventures with both the GOOD Music store and his collaboration with PacSun and Wes Lang that offers Yeezus Tour shirts for $40 per shirt. Merchandise from the GOOD Music store ranges from $34-$160 His less recent collaboration with A.P.C. has also been considered more \"accessible.\"\nYou can check out the new merchandise store at http://goodmusicmerch.com/.",

"I dont think people necessarily understand what happened last week with the Make America Great Again hat. What are you trying to do with the message youre sending?\nIt was really just my subconscious. It was a feeling I had, you know like, people, were taught how to feel. Were taught how to think. We dont know how to think for ourselves. We dont know how to feel for ourselves. People say feel free, but they dont really want us to feel free. And, uh, I felt a freedom in first of all, just doing something that everybody tells you not to do.\n...\nI just love Trump! Thats my boy! You know like, so many rappers, youll look at a video of Snoop Dogg loving Trump, but then he get into office and now they dont love him. Trump is one of raps favorite people right?\nBut we talked about this, that before he was elected president, people in hip-hop it was an in thing to put Donald Trump in your rhymes somewhere.\nAnd by the way, Im in hip-hop but Im not just in hip-hop. Im a black person in the black community but Im not just that. I feel like one thing is that people try to minimize me to artist, hip-hop, black community...Yeah, Im always gonna represent that but I also represent the world.\n...\nYou hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sound like a choice! . You was there for 400 years and it was all of yall?\nIts like were mentally imprisoned. I like the word prison, because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. Its like slavery Holocaust, Holocaust Jews, slavery is blacks...So prison is something that unites us as one race. Blacks and whites being one race. That were the human race.Do you feel that Im being free? And that Im thinking free?\nI actually dont think that youre thinking anything. I think what youre doing right now is actually the absence of thought. And the reason why I feel like that is because Kanye, youre entitled to your opinion, youre entitled to believe whatever you want, but there is fact, and real-world, real-life consequence behind everything that you just said.\nWhile you are making music, and being an artist, and living the life that youve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives. We have to deal with the marginalization that has come from the 400 years that you said, for our people was a choice!\nFrankly, Im disappointed. Im appalled. And brother, I am unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something, to me, thats not real.",
